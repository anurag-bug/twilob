Was glad to see made in India label inside the phone. But when I saw the charger it said "made in china". Still OK. Now I thought of charging the phone a bit.. just 5 minutes after setting the new phone. As soon as I connected the charger to the socket, there was a spark and shot circuit in the charger, phone was not connected. So go disappointed. I am not returning this phone as I have already gifted it. Not sure if Amazon seller would be able to send replacement for the charger alone. Amazon never replaced the product even after multiple conversations..	2
Its not even one year of product purchase, and phone doesn't work well.If we want to make a call, we need to use the earphone, or else we need to put the phone in loud speaker.Back camera doesn't work.Flash light doesn't work some times.Not happy with the product.	1
Very fast processing and very good looking phone at low price experience like Apple phone	5
realy grat product by micromax amazing one more time king back to the market keep it on micromax	5
After 1month useage, in this price range it's good mobile, worth for every paise, camera in normal condition good, finger print okok ,battery for moderate user complete day, sound quality is not up to the mark, screen quality in sunlight good	4
Worst product worst customer service in warranty period	1
Better than Redmi Note 4... Using this phone since last 6 months..no problem at all.. Everything is good in this phone under the price range 10k... A better try from Micromax to get back into the market...	5
Out standing mobile in this price range feel like I phone  7 black color.	5
Highly NOT RECOMMENDEDWhile ordering I was like I'm ordering Indian make handset with patriotic feeling and expected the unexpected :(Pathetic phone, received defected peice, got it exchanged after so much hassle, again received faulty handset. If someone calls me other person can't hear me properly. They think I've put the on speaker and speaking from other room with phone in other room. So awful.	2
Whatever this phone might have been capable of has been completely ruined by the software on this phone and despite almost everybody calling it out to micromax, there is no hint of any improvement regarding the same.After almost an year using this phone, I would not recommend this or any other micromax phone for that matter. To what extent do we settle with this company for the sake of patriotism, atleast the Chinese are working hard and competing with apple, and here is micromax only interested in churning in money by reselling the fruit of Chinese hardwork. Great example of pathetic leadership and certainly not a company that shows any patriotism or deserves the patriotic support shown by Indians towards this company !	1
Got this phone delivered on 15th aug, using it for more than 15 hours now. Facing problem with battery drainage, it reduces like 20% with normal usage in less than an hour. By normal usage I mean even updating the contact details as it is new phone. Also when the phone is not in use i.e on standby it reduces 5-7% in an hours time.So 20% drainage in 1hr is really bad. Hence applying for Return.	2
This is a really worst phone .This phone is arise ao many software problems .Like hanging,slow working apps..Touch will be loose with in a short period of time ..And lack of servicing centers ...Even small crash on phone also this phone unworthy for warranty ... Software update kavalante 300/-.at services centre.,such a big mistake in my daily usage..So plz beware of this phone	1
Amazing Smartphone under 10k, Camera is mind blowing.Everything are working well.No Issues 	5
Phone looks good in all aspects however the display screen heats up while using it for sometime. I received the product yesterday. I will use it for few days and see whether the problem continues. Other than this heating up problem evrything seems to be fine.	4
Battery backup is good, both camera captures good pictures but I would prefer rear camera as 16 mp instead of front camera. One drawback of this phone that it looks like 5.2 inch screen display.	4
Not at all a good phone ...Battery lags and the performance is also not up to the mark.Biggest mistake that I bought it.	1
Excellent made in India product by Micromax, but company is slow in producing more products like this. Market value is less due to costly & slow productions.	5
A very good product under 10k. I'm using it from 10 months and believe me nothing has gone wrong by this phone.Screen is good.Camera is awsm.Sound quality is good.Look is awsm.Overall performance is very nice.The only thing that disappointed me is its battery life.	4
low volumecant speak on this phone unless we use headphoneeven for incoming calls bell doesnt ringshown to many service stations.... no luck	1
I always wanted to buy an Indian phone as a part of promoting Indian market.... This phone really fitted my bill.... Good performance and almost all features of mi series.... I'm loving it.... Not suitable for playing high end graphic games....	4
good	4
It's the phone which has the value for the money you pay.Very gud display and storage.	4
Phone is good. But In this one year, there is No security updates, no bug fixes updates and no Oreo update from Micromax. Worst customer service centre. During the initial release they promised about Oreo update. But even they not providing proper security updates and bug fixes updates.	1
Very bad product, worst picture and sound quality....processor is very low....All my money gine waste...AMAZON....very poor product...you are spoiling your image..	1
Very Good Phone on Battery back UP and other features	5
Lookwise the phone is good. Battery back up also nice. But it hangs up when connected to net. The display also goes blank. You can not use keyboard also. Its bad experience.	3
Dual sim, removavle battery is the best featured offered. But,there is no exchange Blair for this phone.	4
nice mobile. I loved it..........low price but lot of fecilities......but plzzz extened the battery level.........	5
Not a very good phone for price. Lags a bit sometimes. Not that fast, design is cheap.	5
Worth for the money spent ... really happy that I bought this product. If it would have native android it would have been awesome :) although no complains.	4
Worth's every penny. Excellent phone .Only I miss its gorilla glass so you should be carefully handle this and its cover and screen gaurds are not available in market easily	4
Very good for the given price. Been using it for 3 days now, not slow at all. I like it. I feel its one of the best in its price range. Micromax can make a good comeback with this phone.	5
Phone was average but unfortunately it stopped working after 7 months and .. service is even worst I am still waiting for serviced return... my advice never go for any micromax product.. better to buy Chinese at least no service expectations....	2
Just superb in look n performance	4
Good phone.	5
Phone is good for those who use internet and play light games..overall product is gud..battery is good enough..yes heating is there but lite..	5
Very good mobile. Low SAR. Good features. Extremely happy with the performance. Importantly it is an Indian mobile company. Support made in India products.	5

Excellent product	5
i am using this mobile from last 6 month and within 6 months i found that battery backup is not proper system is getting hang, and there is no exchange offer with particular this model even though on amazon..	1
It was worth buying this phone.  Under 10k if you get such features like 13 mp camera both, 18:9 full vision, 3 gb ram, and the best part one can use dual SIM + memory card all 3 are accessible. Battery reasonably Ok, not so good, but not so bad either.	4
Awesome look, perfect front selfie camera, good rear camera, no heating problem, sufficient battery back up, best picture quality.. Full paisa vasul phone.. Thanks Micromax	5
Build quality is ok. It has got good cameras and infinity display for the price	3
I still give 4 to this amazing phone,inspite of little poor in fingerprint sensor.others things are working awesome.	4
Camera quality are good.. Rear and front both are portrait mode..Battery backup was good...Phone are best in this price range	5
Very delicate, screen broke only on a small drop.Camera and screen is good, but the build quality should be improved.	1

Good Phone at affordable price.	4
Its good for the price.	4
Good	5
Best phoneIt has 3gb ram with 32gb storage and works perfectly.Amazon sent it in perfect condition. The delivery was early too!	5
The mobile is very good.It's biggest plus point is it's big screen and the front selfie camera which takes very good pics.Good battery backup. Smooth functioning.Value for money.	5
Amazing screen size beautiful looks nd user friendly recommended for daily use no lagging till now battery backup is quite good I don't no why people criticise it without using it it's best budget smart phone available which is from Indian company	5
Good product fine working	4
Good.But rear camera is not really good as it is said.gaming is okay. UI is complicated.Dedicated sim and memory card slot is good for all.	3
When I ordered the phone will in 2 days it will deliver am so happy this phone is amazing	4
Perfect phone value for money.. camera is excellent. Battery is good. Phone performance is good. Indian brand phone go for it. Much better than MI.	5
Purchased in Dec 2017. Phone hangs very often. Need to restart phone at least 4 to 5 times a day. If phone is not restarted, it is not reachable to others even though there is good network.	1
the phones gets heated up after using the internet for more than 5 min ,not a very excellent product	3
It's cool and have great features,as I'm a student it as all the things what I want . Thank you Amazon . happy.	5
Excellent phone with great features. Make in India... would highly recommend for it.	5
Better options available in the mkt like MI, Asus, Moto etc..battery drains very fast, apps sometimes crash which I believe is bcoz of the 3gb ram..picture quality is not that great..	3
The smartphone that I recieved was made in china .the ui of the smartphone was not at all good .the infinity display was quite impressive.the overall performance of the device was pretty good . It is a great value for money device	4
Overall a good phone but there are no screen protectors in the market for this phone and if by luck u find one then it will not fit on to it	4

First and foremost, I had an excellent experience shopping with Amazon and Cloudtail. My product was promptly despatched reached me within 48 hours. Also, the price at which this phone is being offered by the seller is far cheaper than the price being quoted by the sellers in my locality here in Mumbai suburbs. India Post was very quick with the delivery, and kept me well updated.As for the product, I have used Micromax A310 for the last three years without having to repair it even once in the past three years! It is still in excellent condition. So, I was absolutely stress free when I decided that I wanted another Micromax phone. So far, I absolutely love this piece for the following aspects:-high quality cameras-immersive display-loud and crystal clear sound-customizable UI-absolute smooth functioning (with no heating or hanging)-classy look and feel-the cover, protector, and all the stuff that comes in the box-those lovely in-built Micromax apps (like the alarm which rings even when the phone is off, I can never overlook these tiny blessings)There's too much to add here, but I don't have the time. So, I'll summarize it as a 'must buy.'	5
This is the first Micromax mobile i had bought thinking its made in india. I was bit disappointed as the pack said "make in china". The phone is good and performance so far has been great. Charge remains for a long time ... 2 + days. Camera photos are of good quality.	3
This product is OK OK, can't compite with China sadly, ordered because of Indian company, but it is manufacturered in China, lot of lags switching apps, lots of unwanted notification via micromax app store, can't uninstall it, OK cameras, battery backup is poor, as ram management, purchased for 9500 and now it is at 8400, within a month ,no resale as expected, it is that much annoying the notification are that I have kept it aside, can't use it it is disturbing	2
I have been using this phone for quite a 2 months performance is excellent battery is good No hanging or heating problem	5
Everything is good about this phone. Using since two months. Only problem is it hangs sometimes. And the battery is 2900 mAH which is lesser for a price of 9999	4
All features are best but the battery performance is awesome. I show a film which nearly about 1 hour & 45 minutes but it consume only 12% charge while for same film my redmi mobile consume nearly 35% battery. So i preferred to buy this phone. Camara and other features are also good.	5

The first time I'm writing a review.Absolutely Great device. No display issue as mentioned in some reviews. They probably don't know how to use 18:9 Ratio device. FP is fking Speedy af. Great camera. And Battery *_* 8-9hrs+ on Full time LTE Connection (Browsing.YT.FB.WA.Telegram.G+. Was using yureka 2500mAh which was giving only 3hrs of SOT on 3G. But this 1 is Awsm. 5.7 inch Infinity display gives complete new experience. If u budget is 10k - 11k then go for it. The Best MMX Device till now. LG Q6 Killer. #CanvasInfinity	5
Micromax is back with huge screen with small size body. Although it is a hd screen 720p due to the less bezels on all sides the display looks awesome. Thank you for the 18:9 full vision screen . The only drawback is the back camera and made in China but at this price it's the best deal and micromax also promising that the 48 hours service otherwise they will replace with a new mobile. Battery backup also good it can last for one day easily. There is no fast charging but it's taking around 90 minutes to full charge	4
The touch sensitivity of this phone is totally flawed. You cannot disconnect calls at times. You can'y answer calls at time. Try using the calculator. At times you press on any number, sign ... only "x" sign comes. I have used Micromax before and never experienced such discomfort with any of their phones. This one is really not a phone I would recommend to anyone.	1
Firstly very good phone in this price range. Bought this phone for 9000 after cashback.Good Camera quality.. Front camera is really good and selfiee lovers will like it.Decent battery back up even you use with wifi or mobile data.I am not a game lover so didnt test on playing games.Look & Feel is also good. Strong back case.Good design by micromax.Attractive feature which is full vision display.Very Moderate heating issues which is ignorable.So overall Performance wise i can give rating as 4.Few drawbacks are. No fast charging, Display light is low. Processor is not much latest and it's just quad-core but not octa core. But its okay for this price range.Undoubtedly you can go for it. Good product by Micromax.	4
Good brand good performance awesome experience but battery backup only 1 day!!	4
Happy with the phone and its build quality.....  All good but battery can be better.....  Camera is great  in this price range.... Ur can be better and some pre apps are irritating if u unnistall these apps....  After you restart  or reboot  the phone the apps came along.....  This is sometimes irritating......  Overall in this price range I suggest  you to buy this phone.....	4
Great device under 10k. Bought it almost 50days ago. Extremely satisfied with performance.Pros:1) Great infinity display2) Camera is quite good on both sides. The front flash really Sparks it up.3) super fast charging of 0-100% in about 1-1.2 hours only.4) More than average battery backup.Cons:1) Battery could've been more powerful. It's about 3k mAh.	5
Camera is  superb,especially selfies are superb.Works smoothly,Batary Lasts for a day.(Moderate use).UI is NiceOverall Good phone under 10K compared to MI and Motorola Phones.	5
very good product from micromax value for money .premium quality product.good louder speaker,good os look,good selfie cam and back cam too.faster finger print unlock,headphone not bad.(its better than other headphones included with china brand phone ).	5
Supurb phone...After using iPhone for 6 years I wanted to try an Android device especially Indian made. I am loving this product. Didnt' see a point wasting 60 to 70K to go for an iPhone when better features ( infinity display, 16 MP camera, Android 7.2 ) all are available in 10 K....trust me Netflix , FB and YouTube experience is rocking on this device	5
Nice mobileBack camera averageFront camera awesomeNo hangingExcellent battery backupAmazing display10000rs super mobile	5
Worth for money.I bought it in Amazon last month in the mindset of supporting indian producr. Luckilh working good as expected. A good come back for Micromax in the market.Pros:Good full vision display main reason y chose it.Nougat os and assured Oreo update from mm.Smooth touch n working condition.Camera front 16mp with flash doing good for more than the money given. Decent back cam with 13mp is better taking better than front under flash. Bokeh effect is ok but not equal to potrairt.Finger print is fast enough but 9/10 times accurate.Battery is good with 1 day assured backup for moderate use and 15-18hrs for heavy usage.Premium look and metal body, good to hold.Within 24hr service or replacement guarantee by mm.3gb ram with Snapdragon 425 1.4ghz ok for moderate games not for heavy games.No heat prblm till now.No hanging prblm till now after installing around 20 apps.CONS:No full HD screen only hd plus which is ok for this price.Speaker is not that much loud.Little heavy feel to hold which is habituated to use within a week.720 * 1440 pixels display is not playing not full screen videos in YouTube otherthan that camera video MX player n live TV playing full screen.App centre notifications not clearing untill we open that which is annoying.Go for it if your budget is under 10k.. recommended.	5
Good Phone at this budget.1st Time Micromax Sell a Good Product with All Satisfying Specifications.Good performance,good camera quality,good and large infinity display like Samsun,and battery performance be good.I definitely recommend for this phoneGuys Must Buy This phone.	5
Best phone but please companie service was not improved ur service center in shimoga, Karnataka.  they are not friendly behavior it is the major problem for costemers.	5
It a good phone according to price*even for 1.4 quad core snapdragon 425 processor  giving decent performance*good battery backup*feels sturdy*Avarage camera*lots of unique features*Fingerprint Sensor works perfectly & fast*Good displayIn this price its worth buying	5
Best phone guys becoz Rs9999 smart touch with full infinity display and 16mp selfi quality is 100 out of 100	5
Canvas Infinity is having infinite possibility and fully defining it's name, I am saying because it's being 5 days and still exploring new features of infinity.Due to its slim design and dark black screen its look awesome, all my colleges praise my decision of buying this phone.The 16mp Selfie camera takes awesome selfie, I had never seen before in this price segment.The phone screen is big to watch but the phone feels like small one.The brightness said in reviews were decent but I compared it with Redmi 4 and it was brighter than that, also the battery is good for more than 1 day of moderate useage. The charging time is approx 1 hr 45 min.	5
This phone is amazingSome youtuber says it have low battery but its not true battery backup is good.Display is amazingGaming is also variable or good	5
Liked it, could have been best with more battery capacity. I felt the touch sensitivity is little bit slow on the notifications on screen. Liked the camera features and photo quality. The infinity display could have been covering till the edges of the screen. Overall its a 4 stars product.	4
When I was order it. I didn't expect so much from it. But after using I have totally surprised from its performance. The major thing that surprised to me..it's good looking and no heating issues. Since it has different UI but  it doesn't lag and hang. Overall it is a very good work of MICROMAX TEAM.	5
Premium look.Camera is OK.Sound is clear but earphone sound is not up to mark. Earphone sound like ordinary earphone sound.Battery is OK according to 3000 Mah. if Chinese company gives 4000 Mah then they can't compare with this 3000 Mah.Not able to use in Sunlight.	4
The Phone is good with all specifications but a major problem observed is the Display Screen Resolution Issue while playing any game. The screen cannot adjust the overall in-game display. The screen display (Width-wise) cuts off at the edges of the phone. Even the game pages look congested. I have observed this issue as a major flaw in some games I play. The camera is really good for taking snapshots. The Oreo Android update as mentioned in upcoming updates for November is still not up-to-date. Still waiting for it to come. Hopefully awaiting the screen resolution issueOther than the above mentioned display screen resolution issue observed and the latest Android version still to come the phone has not shown any other issues.	3
Amazingly Best Phone ever!! Canvas Infinity is very light and sleek design made in India. Camera is best,Very Smooth grip and made of Good quality, received in Good condition using this no problem occurred, Best Product By Micromax India.	5
Superb Phone.I have bought it for me. Phone is very handy to use.  There Phone is look a like very good. And Yeah Main Features of PIP Camera and more than option also available inbuilt Camera and UI is not only better but Awesome Ui Of Micromax Canvas Infinity (Microma HS2) And Main Features Of this Mobile Phone's Screen Screen Ration is "18:9" means approxly 93% screen cover of display phone. Keep it Up. and don't more thank about buy this Mobile Phone.......  Just Close Eyes And Buy It.	5
After using this phone one month I write my review ..Looks very nice and standard ..nice mental body and easy to hold .Camera front is awesome 16 mp very nice and clear pic but back camera out of focus but ok can to take nice shot after adjust focus .Battery backup not day last long if u whole day net user u have to charge after 6 or 7 hours after but normal uses full day backup ..Processor is little bit slow compare my mi 4 but ok in 10 k price with infinity display and nice camera and most important don't buy chines phone support our indian brand bcos it's worth phone in 10 k ..in all parameters  .thanks ..	5
Good one but something missing like no application move to external sd cards. No fonts to display. No ram cleaning option.Home ui is copy from I phone. No return by Amazon.Thanking you.	3
Nice smart phone and experience is the best	4
better camera than mi4normal use battery 30 hours (include 6 hrs net surfing,2hrs video, )no heating issuenot for heavy gamersbest selfie camera in this range	5
Great Product from Home Grown Brand Micromax, My First Smart Phone was from this Brand Only, Purchased 1st Launch of Micromax Canvas 2 (A110) around 4 Years Back. Till date this phone works perfectly without any issue.Now Comes Review of Canvas Infinity :I was planning to change my phone to Vivo  / Oppo lastly settled with Full Vision Display Phone that cost under budget with lot of Features. i made the right choice after Buy in 1st Flash Sale on Amazon.Great Product from Micromax. Keep Going.	5
All things are good. List is large so it is not possible to mention here.Except:-1. It should have Gyroscope sensor2. It should have atleast 2 Ah charger.3. It should have better low light camera ( pixelation appears too much in low light).Thats all . If those will then definitely it will best phone of the year in india under 15k sub.	4
Yes it meet my expectation at 7700/- Rs it is was a great buy. But some times, it stop working for few minutes. Camera and touch is good. Overall at this price it is best. But Network band is not so good and in my home I am not getting any signal but other mobile I will get 2-3 bars of signal.	5
this is chinese phone.i feeling guilty after purchasing it.does not matter it have every thing that i need.i purchase this phone because i think it is Indian company but it is chinese product.if i not want Indian phone then i can buy other company phone.After this i think every Indian does not think about Indian phone company.	4
Good phone , good battery backup,  nice design. So many new features light  adaptive screen so back is very good .Leave oppo and vivo buy this value for money and they are providing 24/7 support if any faulty in phone. They called me and took the feedback and said if u find any fault we help u 24/7. Good service I suggest to buy it	5
3 days of use...Looks very good and stylish...Screen is big...Very handy...Can compete with LG Q6...But looks better than LG...	4
Very good phone in this price range, good camera quality, Nice interface..drawback are it don't have Gorilla glass, battery capacity, Processor speedMain thing is it was made by Indian company	5
Wow..... Beautiful and powerful handset from Micromax.GOOD PHONE WHICH IS WORTH EVEN 15K.	5
Its been 1 week since i am using this phone. I am using Micromax phone for the 1st time, I really had trust issues of MM. Still went ahead and purchased after a good research. For 10K, my personal opinion is, this is a good and almost a great phone in this budget. Performance wise its good. It doesn't get heated unlike other MM (my wife uses one, Canvas) / Lenovo K5 (my last phone) models. Camera is good; does a good job. This one may not be ideal for hard-core gamer's but when it comes to a normal gamer like me, i felt phone supports the games to great extend.Only draw back i felt was the audio quality which could have been improved a little more. Bcoz i felt lot of "sound" than audio quality. Not sure is it bcoz of the standard MM headset but thats one factor which i felt a little bad. Also return policy is not a fair one as Amazon wouldnt take it back in the event of any issues. But otherwise, its a nice phone for any who has only 10K budget and looking for a decent phone.	4
Camera capability is very good, even the night shots are marvellous as well, multitasking is just a breeze, I have played need for speed no limit continuously for two and a half hours the phone never showed any lagging being  just a HD display,  but working on split display mode is where 18:9 comes into play and i love this the most.  THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS SLOW CHARGING IT TOOK 2 HOURS TO CHARGE BUT WILL HAVE TO ADMIT BATTERY OPTIMIZATION IS VERY GOOD IT LASTS LONG VERY LONG	5
Its a very nice phone in this range!!Its approximately 1month since using itAnd i m not facing any kind of major problem with my handset.A true worth for money.Sometimes...fingerprint sensor doesn't work properlyBut its very rare...1/100th timesCamera is just awesome..Both front n back are very very good..The feautres i liked the most in Canvas infinity are...:*Mainly...Display....2.5D curved+18:9 display*Camera(13MP...16MP f-2.0)[Both rear and front flash]*OTG supporting*Internal memory(32GB)..[Expandable]*Dual sim(volte supporting)*Satisfying battery*Fingerprint sensorIts far better than LG Q6.The public is....behind...Xiaomi products...only....and ignoring these...best..indian companies...!!!Micromax is back in the race ..with this great phone....Loving the experience...and I want u also to have one....!!Surely...BUY IT...!!!!!!	5
Hi everybody I boght canvas infinity in it's 2nd sales. I bought this to encourage Indian products n to avoid China n other products. I never used any micromax phone before. This is first Indian phone I bought. Comparatively with other brands and in features, this is not good phone.Pros:Display is good, themes and colours are nice, front camera is very nice, light weight, finishing is very nice, battery life is good 6 hrs. Continuous 4g usage is successful.Con's:Slow processor, lags while switching screens even when no apps are open.Hangs frequentlyDoes't support all Indian languages properly, and some fonts.While sending SMS there is no multi contact selection.Some java programmes doesn't work.We cannot install some trading apps Luke Ventura wealth....Rear camera has no quality.Touch is slow.. My launcher is very worst, if u use other launchers like nova, noughat it works well.Dedicated apps like email, torch r missed. We can't move apps to external SD from internal memory.I think micromax didn't work welk while making this phone. Company has to release software updates to make success this phone. Otherwise patriotic people will look for other phones without nation's interest.	3
Review after using Micromax Infinity for more than a month.With the Chinese phones invading the Indian Market, I thought of supporting the Indian Manufacturer Micromax.I started trusting Micromax after purchasing a LED TV for a good deal.But there are 5 instances in these 2 months made me to regret for choosing Micromax Infinity. 1. The front camera response was damn slow during an office event made me embarrassing infront of others.. It took long time for processing the image. Had to hold my hand in same position after clicking the image. Sometime after 5 sec hold I took and the processed image was blurred. 2. One day, the touch screen became non-responsive and it was behaving weird. All of a sudden some random video from the Gallery will start playing. Had to remove the battery and reboot. Situation didn't repeat after that. 3. Earphones Issue : As soon as I connect my JBL earphones, it keeps on prompting for "Tap to Mute" & "Tap to Ring" not allowing me to access the Home screen or open Music app. I have to keep the music app ready before connecting earphone. 4. The Music app does not stop during Incoming call. I was riding my bike with music on from this phone. When I stopped I noticed 5 missed calls and it says it Rang 5 times and the music didn't even stopped. It was shocking for me. When connecting the headset it automatically goes to DND mode and calls are not notified. Atleast the Music should stop when the call lands your phone.. 5. The Finger print sensor is very slow and I have reposition my finger to access..Not sure all these above are tested during Phone Manufacturing.Still many Indians are ready to support Indian products please dont make them regret for their purchases.Suggestion : When I bought the 50 inch LED TV it was half the price of other big brands, I chose Micromax. When I wanted to support Micromax Infinity phone, there were many other options in the same price bracket and even lesser than 10K. Choice is yours	3
Revised review after 6months of usage:Phone is working absolutely fine and I am satisfied.  I got OTA update after which small hanging  problem (after data button turning ON) is gone. Good work by developers.Original review:One thing that is not mentioned anywhere is its SAR value. Its 0.294w/kg at head and 0.602 w/kg at body which is very much below accepted value of 1.6w/kg.Coming to the review: I have been using this phone from last 10-12days. Phone is good looking and performances of both camera's are good. As per other reviews already suggested go for this phone if you want general use like browsing, streaming, clicking pics & selfies :) Battery backup is satisfactory and lasts for a day with medium usage. But in return to bit lower battery capacity we get lighter and sleek looking phone :)18:9 screen size is a great USP of this phone and display is good.( I mean who goes to see PPI of the phone. 283ppi is close to retina display).Conclusion: Go for this phone without hesitation and any fear. My friends were smiling weirdly when they saw that I purchased Micromax phone. But after looking at the phone I didn't require any justification to be given to them ;) :)	5
This phone has everything, Front Camera is so nice that we fell that it's like a mirror. Only draw back is Battery, but still it is ok to survive for the day.In this range we cant expect more than this.Screen guard given is not a good quality, instead given tempered glass.There is a problem in Whats app, msg will be not received/delivered sometimes till we reboot the phone, micromax please look into this.	4
	5
Battery backup mast hai look s8+ ke jaiseSab kuch gajab hai value for moneyAur dehati bolu to le ke pachtaoge nahi bharosha karoBas thoda slow charging hai. Bass	5
Everything is good with this phone but disappointed with it's camera.Back camera is not too good if u want to click pictures in low light or in night...So little disappointed with this...	4
Very interesting mobile micromax canvas infinity is a very good product. I am felling better for used this mobile.This product is very well feauters in low price.This product  is comptiter ability compared to n another mobile in the market.thanku for all micromax canvas infinity service team.	5
Even 3gb ram mobile starts complete. Hanging when doing call bulk massaging	1
nice phone with outstanding camera  quality but there is whatsapp problem in this phone phone gets hang sometimes when you starts net and whatsapp message starts coming otherwise is is very nice phone with excellent camera (both front and back) with good battery backup	4
Micromax Canvas Infinity (Black, 18:9 FullVision Display)Yeah almost satisfied product for 10K and also 5.7 display but battery power is 2900 it could be better if battery power is above 3500 but still its not bad. go for it  it'sbest budget smartphone	4
Hi I purchase on 5th sept phone is good camera quality good front flash available but phone be hanged sometime	3
Best phone in this rangeWhy I pay 22000 for vivo 7When I got same features except 4 GB ram and 64 GB instead I get 3gb and 32And additional 18:9 display	5
After a week usage of the set,i can conclude the following points1) it's battery backup is good,for whole day usage.It went from 60% to 20% after a play session of about 2-3 hours.2) runs games at a pretty good speed,sometime u will see lags.But they are playable,this include all games.3) camera quality is average,dont expect much from both of the cameras.4) one thing I like is the screen.Its freaking awesome,watching HD film is a treat for me.5) buy this product for two reason I) it's an Indian product not made in India but the company is Indian. ii) screen.	5
Best phone of Micromax...Thank you Micromax...	5
Great come back by Micromax...Infinity is with excellent  16 mp camera, 5.7" screen, 3gb RAM, smart functions, sound quality, storage, light weight and it's within just Rs.9999. Just 2 things could have been better. One is processor n other is battery. To charge the phone it takes around 2.5 hours. But once charged it remains for 6-7 hours on avarage usage.Keep it up Micromax...	4
As expected. Best phone in this price range using it for last 2 weeks .no lagging problem .best phone for teen-agers not for heavy gamers .this phone enhances your personality everything is perfect in this mobile .best mobile by Micromax till date 	5
good  camara especially selfie. Battery back up is also fine average 1.5 days with dwell sim and wifi working continuously . Good phone in this range .	5
The phone does not connect calls!!! Can you believe it?!!!I got a replacement phone from Amazon after technician visit for the first defective phone and even the replacement phone does not connect calls!!!Incredible. Little wonder Chinese phone makers are sweeping the market.By the is Amazon selling refursbished phones as new??	1
Enjoying using the device.	5
Bahut hi shandaar mobile h...best mobile in this price range.....aur jo log bad review de rahe h wo chinese mobile k broker h.....be aware of chinese brokers.	5
A must buy smartphone if you are a selfie-addict. The 16mp front camera sensor is really a magic. The 13mp primary camera captures detail in such a way that it actually doesn't look like a below 10,000 variant. I will surely recommend this for students. If you are tech-spider and heavy user this phone is certainly not your best choice.	5
Best PhoneGood Camera both rear and front, fine touch scree, good battery back up, good processing speedAs per the mobile feature price is too good,Absolute worth product, a must buy, value for money	5
The phone looks great.  Works fluently. Great job by Micromax.Just two things are lacking :1. Rear camera quality is not good.2. Direct Video call feature is not available.Otherwise  worth buying it.	4
Overall working is good (after 5 and half month of uses).....(4.2/5)No heating problem.No lags.Camera quality is good (front 4.5/5 and back 4.0/5).Internet speed is too good!!! (4.7/5).Battery life still good - on normal to heavy internet uses (3.5/5).Display is good but not as advertised.....it's average (3.8/5).One can go for it!!!..... recommended strongly!!!....Abhi tak iss mobile ne dukh nhi Diya....lagta hai Lamba saath nibhayega!!!	5
Hello to all i purchased this mobile from amazon for my dad i just download wt s up and now mobile storage showing is full infect non of function are working mobile showing device is full kindly help me 9785334612	1
Hello, I am writing this review after one month use of Micromax Canvas Infinity (Black). I bought it @ 8499/- specially because of INDIAN Brand, but it is a 'Made in China' product.NICE: Camera, Touch, Battery and Display.The phone is Good and I am happy and satisfied with my decision to buy it and its performance. The phone doesn't hang and no heating or very minor heating is observed. Camera is good in day light specially front camera though low light shots were not as nice as it should be. No blot-wares were installed during use and the phone updated three times during this time ??? (I don't know what was the update for).DISLIKE:The phone falls very short (on my expectation) on user interface, though it has a clean and simple interface. I found issues and lack of even basic features in interface though it might overcome in future updates.But the bottom line is Micromax Infinity is Good phone and will not disappoint you if you go for it, but you'll be missing some of the basis user features in its interface.	4
Awesome phone.After using it for 10 days I feel why people are wasting money in Vivi v7& v7+ wherein this phone comes with infinity display with premium metallic look. If I talk about performance the phone didn't lag at all while multitasking as well as while playing games. Battery could have been better like 3500 Mah or so but still gives 8 yours heavy usage on 4g network. Amazing phone. Thanks Amazon and Micromax for such an amazing phone.	5
1st time i am satisfied with this smartphone i have purchased lot of smartphones but micromax infinity is totally impressed me and i love itbest part of this phone is display and camera excellentfront camera amazing better than other smartphone in this prize rangeno heating issue, display feel like royalstorage and ram awesomei mean one word review= excellent	5
Great Indian phone but all parts made in china.searching a name in contacts getting multiple name, For ex. If I have 'Ganesh.s' in my contact list then when I type Ganesh.s it's show triple entries in the search list. In-fact I've selected the contacts to display as PHONE CONTACT ONLY. All settings done properly, but still unable to merge the contacts. It's show no contacts to merge. Micromax team please update on this.	5
This handset have hanging problem please don't buy this	1
Its a mixed bag. The things I like about it is the screen ratio, slim form factor and battery life.Things I don't like is the pushing of ads. Its irritating. And apps get cut or shrunk due to display form factor. And at times the phone freezes. Micromax still hasn't figured out software optimization. The hardware isn't great. Snapdragon 425 is a below average CPU. Not good for gaming. Sound output via speakers are OK, but not up to mark via 3.5 mm audio jack.And 16mp front facing camera is just for sake of numbers. What will the pixels do if the optics are mediocre. I have seen many low megapixel cameras do a great job than this. Requires lot of light for good snaps.	3
Good phone. Specifications mentioned in the site are as given. I am still checking out the features.Cons - (features I found missing)1. No options found to customize the contacts displayed.2. Only one single phone profile available. No profile settings like Silent, Meeting, Outside etc. found. You have to change individually any options required for the situation.	4
Excellent mobile... Super display...... Camera best for oru money.. video play gud.... Audio quality ok........	5
I got this pbone on 10th sep 2017 from amazon and have been using it from past 2 days. I would must say that this is best phone in the market in the price range of Rs 10000 .Here are some things which i liked in canvas infinity-1. The 16 MP front facing camera is taking very good pictures.2. The display quality is very good and the phone look very beautiful with this 18:9 ratio scree.3. The latest Android version 7.1.2 make it bater.4 . Phone runs smoothly with 3 GB ram.5. We can also use micro SD card along with two sim cards.My overall experience for this phone is very good.I would recommend this phone to everyone who want a phone in Rs 10000 price range.	5
Using this phone since 1 month and faced a couple of problems like . Many a times phone screen shows playing tone and it's  arise anytime when playing video using Whatsapp etc I hate it literally it bothers me too much . I want this problem to be solved when switch on this phone it doesn't recognize my password instantly even if the password is correct . I  have to wait for at least 5 min then only it accept my password and i can't use my fingerprints to unlock this phone after switching on other wise fingerprint scanner is working . And talking about the battery it usually drains after 1.5 day for normal users and when I charged it fully 100% battery drains quickly . It doesn't show wifi linking speed on the screen . And it doesn't have note making app in this phone like mi is having .  The temper which comes with delivery is of very low quality . There is no use of Appcentre in this mobile when we can use Google play store to download apps . Appcentre only provides us with  a couple of apps not of our choice and it install apps  in the phone without asking the user which the user have to uninstall and notification of this Appcentre doesn't remove from my screen even if I swap I only have to open up all the notification of Appcentre to close them even after I had silenced the notification of this app and it doesn't shows my lock screen wallpaper which is very disappointing . camera works perfectly it pretty good but it is not having bokeh effect which is written in it's description overall the phone is good I am satisfied . I got Amazon gift card worth rupees 50 which could be used to purchase anything but, I recharged my mobile and got a cash back of rupees 25. Because I ordered my phone in offer period of which I was unaware so it was gift for me from Amazon on Valentine's day 	5
A great phone below 10k . The snapdragon processor is old but still you can run pretty much every game on this phone with minimal heating isues. The camera is great too.	5
Honestly saying that... Go for it... Literally m well satisfied with this mobile....My friends always suggest me to wait for redmi 5 but now I feel that my decision to purchase infinity mobile  is osm...I feel that m using iphone inside phone...Due to XOS operating system..Battery backup for those whose internet is  always on and constantly surfing whole the day is about 12 hoursNormal users sometimes keep net off can standby whole day...Sound osmA very best thing about this phone ..It's not heating at all as other even after playing heavy games like asphalt 8 and no laggingCharging time is 3 hours or less approx and 100 approx mins. In switch off condition.Yaa you can say only one thing that is touch compatibility is bit lower then redmi...Touch sensitivity bit low...So starting m thodi problm hoti thi type krne m..But this is not a big issue...no problm at op...1.5 gb ram free rhti h26 gb something storage free rhta hPortrait mode on both selfie and real camera...Camera really awesome....M pure din bus camera camera and cameraThanksOr kuch janna ho...To puch lena...	5
I have been using this for quite sometime. Initially this was the best phone, but somehow now its gotten slower, getting heated so much faster, and the charging I have do it twice in a day for medium use. Otherwise the photo quality and interface is gud. i definitely recommend for a cheap buy and medium use. not for heavy smart phone use.	4
Wish I could rate this bad as I suffered. I am Debadatta Shankhua, from Bangalore. I am using this phone since Sept 2017 and I regret I didn't go for MI phones. Got this @ INR 9630.00 but not upto the quality what I thought it would be. So many issues with this phone. Having said that this phone has so many issues, please don't buy this. Go for MI phones. Value your money and your hard work.Hope this would help you before you go for this one.	1
I ordered this product thinking about made in india.  But i am totally dissapointed by seeing the package, battery and mobile as made in china. Phone also heating much and speed is not like 3gb.  I personally will not encourage others and its not made in india	1
Great phone but some time fingerprint not working properly and battery backup improve required	4
I bought this phone at mid 2017.And I didn't expected a phone to give so many features (totally new) at such a great price.	5
Looks good but works badIt's just 4 days since I purchased this frustrated with its performance.Internet is not connecting. I removed the sim and tested the same sim to other device then it is working. Wasted money on this.Worst product.	2
Pros1. Looks Premium2. Awesome Camera3. Light Weight 160g4. SLIM 8MM5. Simple and easy user interface6. Battery.Cons1. Processer	5
I bought it on 22 Sep for 9999. The quality is good.. you will get a silicon cover in box. I like this phone. Has a better front cam than a rear cam. The quality is sober. Very good in this range. Plus it has very gr8 ambient to use.The screen is curved. Has 18:9 ratio.So far so good..Loved it.	4
Third class product as well as service, Screen was broken and mobile was just fall down from 6" height and it screen was broke, Some time hang but the worst part is service i called to micromax and visit service station four time no body is there to revert every time they told come tomorrow final i met the person  and they are bluntly told all is chargeable but it is under warranty.	1
All new innovation super and wroth for money.Only battery while using internet charge will reduced.Compare other equal price phone micromax is very good.	5
Good PerformanceGreat Screen Viewing ExperienceGood Battery BackupGreat looksGreat price rangeGood Camera quality Front Camera flash is great for night selfiesOverall 4/5 must buy in budget of 10k	5
Dual sim,  decent cameras , separate memory card slot, 18:9 fast touch screen , value for money	5
Don't buy this mobile,its like toy available in fair with all extraordinary future which runs only for 1 month. Fully wasted moneyI think they have launched this by directly manufacturing without any testing features for money making.They are making us fool.Daily I have to switch off and on at least 2 times if display,many apps not works.	1
Front camera is really good, runs smooth but battary backup is not good at all only 1 hour of gaming and normal use will drain the whole battary before the day ends. No heating issue but the fingerprint sensor suddenly stops working then I have to restart the phone and after that it starts working again. Now after 3-4 months of use it has a display problem there is yellow colour patch on the top left corner which can be seen whenever there is a white background or light colour background which is pretty annoying even though it has a low price but atleast this is not what I wanted to happen.	4
Nice to see Micromax getting innovative. It's a quality phone with features packed at this price. Recieved the phone today and haven't used it all day long in context of the battery sustainment. Overall a nice package and might give tough competition to its rivals.	5
It's a fabulous phone excellent camera and screen it's soooooooooo good and the sound is quality is soooooooooo nice	5
Micromax CEO promised for Oreo in this Smartphone but till not available....Thanks for giving us infinity. but if you give in Octacore ..that should be a great smartphone...a stone mile for Micromax company	5
One of the best Micromax phone. Infinity display at just 9999 wow, performance is average but good smartphone and good service of Amazon.	5
Bought Micromax for d first time after going through so many reviews on YouTube... But I must say it is totally worth it for the price... Awesome camera quality... Awesome phn and display... I heard on YouTube about it's speaker output is a bit low but it is not that low... Great value for money product... Must buy in this price range...	5
Im writing this after a year. The phone works good , main problem is that it takes much more time to recharge the battery now than before. Also the charger is making problems but I used a different charger and now all works good.This phone is now more awesome with this new update	5
Those who want to buy a mobile under 10k can go for it. As per its price, It will not disappoint u in performance. Indian brand but made in China(manufactured). But it's not a China Mobile. #INDIANwillBUYit	5
Purchased on 12/09/2017 ,nice packaging,fast delivery,canvas infinity nice phone ,nice camera,everthing is fine in this 9999 price tag	4
It's looking good, I used very smoothly. It's battery back up is one day and camera in good quality. Overall features in cool. Superb Mobile...	4
I was under a very good opinion about Micromax  mobile phones. But it's very  unfortunate that the efficiency of the mobile which I have received is very very very poor. I want to exchange - but I have received it exactly a month back i.e., 22.09.2017. can I go for exchange or return of this product please.....?	1
1. Best looking smartphone2. Display is good and clear3. Camera is owesome cant get better in this price segment4.battery is only 2950 mah but blive me it behaves as if it is more tha 4000 mah, battery will surely impress you.5. Dedicated memory card slot6. Removable battery7. No heating problem at allOnly problem with it is that display is not protected. You have to take care and finger print sensor work good 9/10 times.	5
Android Nougat is not at par with my previous phone's cyanogen OS. At least half a second lag in response. Downloaded the latest upgrade but still the same. Camera quality is OK. File manager app that I installed from play store is unable to move or delete files. App permission issue. Doesn't show which permission required. Tried by providing all access from app management, but such a versatile app is not allowed on my phone. Somebody please suggest a way out.	3
Everything is good, the look is amazing. It is a revolution in the history of Micromax.The only issue is the camera, which is not up to the mark as far as the declared camera quality is concerned which is 13 and 16 MP camera.Although the camera is fine.The front look is literally amazing.	4
Good phone in this price range. Suited for normal day to day usage.Goods:1.Large screen suited for watching HD movies.2.Battery lasts more than a day with moderate usage.3.Performance is as expected, no lags while playing heavy games like Asphalt84.Dedicated memory and 4G sim slots, and also removable battery.5.Overall look and feel is premium.I have taken out one star cause :1. Takes more time to charge, takes around 3 hours to charge from 20%-100%. expected a fast charger.2.The screen display is not so crisp and sharp. Though you cant make out unless you have used premium mobiles.3. Edit- Fragile screen with no gorilla glass. Screen shattered the first time it fell.	3
Best mobile phone. Both front and back camera s are amazing. Super pixel feature is wonderful in capturing minute details. It brought back my hobby of photography. Fingerprint sensor fast ram removable battery separate memory slot infinity display are wonderful. Screen is cool on my eyes. One handed operations are easy Hindi writting app is not good. No fast charging.ibut over all good satisfactory performance	5
I bought this one a month ago..There are soo many issues with this mobile,when you tries to call someone,mobile screen automatically gets locked and its not at all responding till we disconnects the call..Only Battery backup is good.I thought that i will get the best mobile,But i didn't.Very disappointed.	2
Phone looks gud only in outward appearance.Call quality (the basic function of a mobile) not gud. Inaudible and mumbled voice output on earphones. Tried different earphones but result always same. Front camera quality okay but main camera poor quality which is even worsen by poor quality display. Don't go for it coz better phones available in this range. Even one year old Lenovo k6 is working better than this. Buttons on display not as gud in operation as advertised.	1
Really,the screen and the touch is fabulous,graphics intelligent and a very accurated android makes the phone eye-catching.a great mobile for India.No heating,charging time is 45-60 min,camera is awesome	5
I liked this phone very much...it's almost similar to Samsung j7 Max...then y pay extra...go for this phone. Camera clarity is good.it also looks biguser friendly...	5
HORRIBLE PHONE...THE PHONE IS DEAD IN JUST 3 MONTHS.CUSTOMER CARE IS HORRIBLE.MICROMAX COMPANY MUST BE BANNED.ITS A FRAUD COMPANY.	1
It's a good product and value for money as compared to vivo and other infinity display phones but sometimes it give continuous alerts of messages message app is not working properly	4
I would say that It Good Phone in 10k range. I am sharing my experiences of this phone.Memory: It is giving on 22GB for storage (10 GB used by systems)Processor(Speed): Speed is very good.Battery: Wifi(32Hrs), With mobile internet(25 Hrs),Display : Display is best in 10k range phone(You can face some touch issues)Camera: Front Camera is good not best event it is 16MP and 13MP.	4
After using for 1monthHardware - 4of5 star (it is premium/steady)  Droped the phone from shoulder hight withot back case and was surprised to see the phone survived without any dent or damaged screen..Software - 2.5of5 star (integration could b better)  This phone is a best buy for normal user  As it lags a little while multi taskingBattery - 4of5 star (survive a day even if the internet is on)  4of5 star (charging time from 0to100% 2-3 hrs approx)Sound - 4of5 star (loud/clear)Vibration - 4of5 star (moderate)Voice call quality - 4.5of5 star (clear)Network - 4.5of5 star (no network issue)Earphone - 3of5 star (music)  2of5 star (for call as the voice is to sharp)Camera - 5of5 star (front is awesome)  4of5 star (rear is good)	4
Good and reasonable.... i like itthnq for amazing deal ..	4
9499/-Lightweight, Decent phone with superior handling. Display and cameras are 4/5Battery is 3.5/5VFM is 5/5	4
Its a perfect phone in 10k range. i am using this device from 6 days.In review many people criticized it for low processor.But its working well as i can play Asphalt fluently.Both the cameras are ok.No preinstalled useless apps.You can even uninstall some of the preinstalled Apps.Look is cool.Its handy!!!!! And in last there is ok type Earbud,Back cover and tempered glass provided with the pack.Overall a wonderful product by Micromax.	5
Not the greatest phone but great value for money.Build quality is gorgeous. It gives off an expensive taste of a high end phone even though it's nowhere near the price. It doesn't have a gorilla glass on front so If you don't case this phone immediately you will regret it.Phone's performance is smooth and makes it worth the price. I use my phone as a phone and I don't use it for gaming. It's smooth as butter for the tasks I use it for.Camera quality is good enough.The phone's also got some drawbacks... There is tons of bloatware as to be expected. A good chunk of them are uninstallable. The speaker is not quite loud and finger print sensor refuses to work sometimes.That's all I have for now. So far so good. Great for those who are not big on special brands.But as it stands I'd rate this phone a solid 4/5.Size is great; screen is nice, Very small bezel, Battery lasts fine... try it.	4
great phone for this cost... Micromax comes back with a bang..... I love my phone... great Micromax keep it up.. good going guys...	5
Fantastic cellphone with 10k prize.Front camera is good...Back camera is ok..Battery is good...Fingerprint sensor response is very good..Display is also nice...GUI is ok..No facility to dial video call directly.. you need to install Apps for video call...Sound and speaker is good... Speaker is sometimes bit loud...Gaming is average...One disappointing thing is, It has written "Made in china" (hence given 4 star)... Being an Indian company, Micromax should manufactur the phones in India...Overall good product by Micromax....	4
Nice phone, Nice camera  and good battery backup but sometimes while during in videocalling my battery percentage has quickly down and otherwise all are very good with packing and I m satisfied with Canvas Infinity than Infocus Vision 3#Well Thanks Amazon	4
good phone......worth money.....impressed.......#not impressed with its camera....rest all salient features are awe	5
This mobile is really so good. A very large and clear display. Battery life is so good and with stand for 2 days even for full internet and call usage. Very handy with Android 7 look so good user interface and icons. Really value for money.	5
Awesome phone.. display quality superbGreat work on phone fantastic ... value for money ...and for battery life 5 star out of 5..Battery life superb.... INDIAN ' company rocks	5
Awesome Product. It is a nice product with the price. Nobody gives you this specification at this Price. One main drawback is that charging time is more than other devices.	5
Great Value. Good camera screen speakers. Micromax has definitely nailed it.I use this as my primary phone over my iphone 7 now	5
Guys,I don't usually write reviews. But, for the guys who are saying that they are facing lag issues & hang problem-- Please disable the Magnification Gesture. And any other gesture which you might have enabled at the phone startup.Your problem will go away !Cheers.Only front camera is good though. Rear camera quality not that good. But works for 9999 range.	5
Not good to buy... incoming voice problem, automatic switchoff and hanging problem also. I bought on 22 January 2018 and it's only 2 month and so many issues.	1
Nice phoneNo hang no heatingGreat touch and cameraNice fingerprintGood battery backupOnly problem is that can't find tempered glass of this model which perfectly fits it.Overall a nice phone	4
After 3 days of usage, I would say it's a great mobile from Micromax. My review based on usage is...Pros:Premium look & build qualityFront camera is goodNo lagging issue till nowBattery lasts for 1 day after moderate useProcessing speed is averageCons:Portrait games display is been cut from d sides, it's bcoz of 5.7 inch sizeBack camera worst	4
Back camera is not good it's like 5mp. I see grains in the screen. Front camera is good. Phone is s good phone. It's fast, better quality, battery n slim. Looks nice. Sound quality is also good. Supports 2 Sims n SD card at the same time. Fingerprint scanner s fast.	3
Very good phone...I love phone size and screen. Screen is very bright and can view in sunlight also.--UI is good.--Battery last for day.. good--I load many apps to Chech processing... Found good.--i don't play games..so not loaded any.--Camera pixel is good. But it doesn't cancel light ray in picture.  I think there it has an issue.Check photo attached.	3
Awesome mobileVery good camera and soundqualityAnd good battery backup	5
After using it for one month am writing this review...Please don't buy it, there are so many draw backs that I have found while using...1) Internet connection is very poor while connected to mobile data, it shows the connection but there is internet access.2) Very poor screen quality, although it's not a gorilla screen but they should have given better one. There are few lines visible in the background of the screen when it is locked.3) The call is automatically getting disconnected while talking.this is not because of signal, it is purely mobile fault.4) camera quality and battery backup is OK.	2
I bought this after much research, and with some trepidation since I had never bought a Micromax product before. I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, Amazon was pretty quick in delivery. But the phone per se blew me away for the kind of price tag it came with. It packs quite a punch in almost all departments, and is real value for money. I write this after a week's usage. I use the phone largely for calling, surfing the net, messaging,  listening to music, watching videos, but not for gaming. The display may not be 100% edge-to-edge but it is far superior to those of normal phones. I bought the phone only because of the bezel-less display & I was not disappointed. Despite buyers cautioning about poor battery life and some lag, with my kind of middle-to-light usage, the battery lasts as much as 3 days. Even if you are a heavy user, I suspect it will last well over a day. There's an interesting battery-saver feature which kicks in when battery is at 15%, after that, battery lasts even longer till it dies out. The widgets may be rather small but you get used to it. Its also got the latest Android version so need for any updates. There's complete ease of use. The glass is not Gorilla and I think that's a drawback but according to me, the only one. I did play some basic games on it and there was no lag at all, despite reviewers saying so. Maybe, the lag is noticeable in the high-end games, I don't know. For the price tag it comes with, this one is quite the thing.	4
This handset is most worst handest i perched from amazon. The day i received it, on that same day it  it got hunged for 3 times,  it started getting hanged everyday, cant complit the calls & it get hot too much, which is so poor quality product. Called Amazon, they sent technician, which is most unqualified person, as per him the hanset is ok, as he left, the handset got hannged for the 3 times, called again Amazon, they say, they cant return it, & suggest to visit the Micromax service center & get repair. This is the most  third grade service Amazon give & sell such third grade product. Its zero value for money, zero corporative support  from Amazon & now its only work left, to go to service centre & take the again yuk reply. I need to return this third grade handset & want my money back. Never buy, Micromax and any products from Amazon.	1
So where shall I start ..hmmIt's almost 10 months since I have been using this phone. I must say I have had no issues whatsoever.So let's go detail by detailsThe display is really good. And the back camera is really clear at 13 mp and front camera with flash is also awesome with 16 mpNow the battery has gone down a bit in performance after almost 9 months but I have been using heavily the internet with games like ( COC, Dominations, Candy crush,etc..)and lots of software too still the battery lasts a whole day.. if under used the battery last more than a whole day almost 24 hrs and more.I have uploaded a picture taken from the rear camera to give u an idea of clarityAmazon was quick in it's delivery and I was impressed.Sound vice it lacks a punch but with headphones it's great.I love this phone for this low budget I hope it keeps going for another year.Not bad given 3 GB ram and 32 gb space inbuilt with upgrade availability to 128 gbBut the one main con is that it has no fast charge which means once fully down it takes nearly 2 hrs to get fully charged that's the one drawbackOverall Happy customer with this Indian phone lives up to the price	4
The breadth of the phone is too small on the lenght is big phone with 4 inch screen have bigger length than this one.only the features are good.	3
Superb camera quality.. better than others mi vivo in this range... Better than note 4 also.. little bit hang when net turn on.. go for it.. awesome display quality like S8.	4
Guys nothing much , but in 10000 the best mobile i can say because i m also using the mobile from last 3 months and fully satishfied with this mobile . Really appreciable.	5
Amazing product by Micromax.. something different from what is available in the mobile market..	5
Worst phone I had ever used in my life , in just 5 days its screen was not working bad touch and lay in notification bar low quality things are used to make this phone,that's why it is very cheap too much of lags, bad fingerprint sensor "beckaaar"	1
i like this phoneit got 18:9 ratio screen which is good in this range  camera of the phone is also goodthe most surprising this about this phone is the phone battery which is 2900mah but i thought it work of 4000mah battery i got 2days backup with heavy use of itif u want phone In this Budget range then just go for iti hope u like the phone	4
Gifted to my dad... he loved it ... screen is big... quality of the screen is little low compared with Samsung... but all the other features are awesome... at this price range it might be the best phone for you... !!!	5
I ordered this Micromax Canvas Infinity as a gift for my son who was entering his teens. The delivery was prompt and arrived as scheduled. But when my son opened the phone after I gifted it to him, It didn't start. Assuming that the battery must have been completely drained I connected it to the charger.and to my surprise the phone didn't charge beyond 50% stage. To top it it just switched off when disconnected the charger.MY WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS PURCHASE DEFEATED...	1
This phone is awesome with any angle.Display is attractive. Camera is awesome at this price. Battery is also good.Truly very happy with is phone...	5
The product is not what you get. Not because of Amazon, but Micromax. The picture they advitise is not the actual phone..it has big besal and it's no where related to infinity display.Also poor quality. After using it for 8-9 months, I had to take it to service centre for two manufacturing defects. I'm going to change the phone since it is again showing issues.It will work ok for 1month if you are lucky.	1
realy nice super i like it...mi note 4 se acha he.no heating proble  enjoye gameing	5
Phone is good... But just after 2days the fingerprint sensor stopped working. If I restart the mobile then it works for few times & again stops working. I am not sure that this issue is only with my mobile or with every mobile set. Rest of the things are good. I would have given 5star if the fingerprint sensor issue was not there.	3
This product so many option not there (example -volt enable option not in mobile. only available Lte enable option )than this mention 5.7 inch but really not this size ,Than,finger print not properly work very slow. specification ?Return Policy show but when we use return option this not accept our request not process	2
Value for money product, can't find any problem till the date	5
Nice phone verry good but cover and glass not avilabal in shope	4
Good budget phone at this price. Everything is quite nice. Just it takes too much time for charging but good battery backup. Phone is for moderate users. Screen, picture quality and touch quality is quite nice u won't be disappointed with this phone. Selfi camera is owsome but rear camera is not so impressive.	4
Good screen quality also the camera is goodProcessor must need to improveLooks premium in hand nice designI am not a hard core gamer so it feels good for me can't expect more in 10 K	4
best phoneboth cameras are awesomebetter than redmi, oppo and vivo	5
Simply awesome product from Micromax...will suggest Micromax to bring such innovative products rather than rebranding product...all the way it look such a premium product with brilliant front camera quality and all... next product should be dual camera and 4mah battery obviously 6inc in 18:9 aspect ratio which will killer product	5
I am the owner of tech channel on YouTube. My channel's name is ihax.inc. you can check it out. So, I bought this phone on the first sale and I have used this product for 2 weeks i guess. First of all i would like to say that the look of this phone is amazing. It feels very handy and best to be fit in your pockets. Screen is quite impressive. I have faced some also like hearing, sometime fingerprint scanner are not working, notification light not working properly for messages and one handed mode out of 1/10 times didn't work properly. But i guess the future update these problems will be sorted out. I got a call from micromax today to tell about them the pros and cons of this phone. The split screen feature is awesome, 3 finger swipe screenshot always work properly, long screenshot feature also work well, tha cam performance is good, the cam modes are really good. Speaker quality is also good. I didn't face any lagging issues till now all the apps are working properly but sometimes Instagram crashes but this might be the problem in the app itself. For average daily use battery stays whole day after full charge but if you are constantly using the phone the battery will drain out withing 6-7hours.  At last the overall performance of this phone is  good and if you are thinking to buy this phone then surely go for it. And do check my channel on YouTube.	4
Excellent phone with great features n with latest Android version. And the hardware is ready for next Android version. So you don't need to change phone for using new Android version. Excellent cameras n large screen will definitely change experience of using Android phones. Really a revolutionary phone at great price.	5
Very goood phone in this price range .No hangingSmooth performanceGood multitasking capabilityBest display	5
Awesome, amazing, fantastic product... The product is same as it is shown and the features too... Who ever are willing to buy it u just go for it cause such featured mobile nd in this cost is truly amazing... Thanks a lot amazon for this i just loved it.. At the it's very first the charging of the battery was little slow... But as now m using it charges early and also the charge retains.. Camera is damn awesome... The clarity of camera is so awesome...	5
Very disappointed with this product. I got a defective product and when i talked to customer care executive, they said they will send technician for verification, then product will be replaced or returned....	1
wonderful  mobile. i am getting  backup  more than expected. Stylish  mobile	5
Best phone which excels in most of the required parameters; design, display, performance, camera, battery backup in every fields it maintains a special quality which make it different from others.Don't give your ear to negatives, because they think negatively.It's a ground breaking piece in the Indian Smart phones market.You can get the battery backup for minimum two day of normal use.The design is great, it gives us a something different look.Thank you	5
Worst phone ever ...battery guzzler..irritable user interface...complexiety is more..many preinstalled ...camera is always on without u knowing it...got inbuilt pm modi app which does not go even if u want to delete it..	1
This mobile is super ultimate.. I am just in love with this mobile. At such a nominal price, you are getting awesome features what else you need....If anyone is looking for a budget mobile with such an amazing features, go ahead and blindly buy this mobile... You will be never regretting to buy this mobile....	5

Earlier I was using Micromax unite. Keeping this in mind, I thought of purchasing Canvas infinity, a higher version. Of course, with a compatriot's angle I did so. But it is not at all up to my expectations. Finger sensor is poor, so are some features. Sometimes the touch screen is not working properly. The features are not user-friendly. A person new to it finds difficult to use it. I thought it would be easier as I had Micromax model earlier but this Canvas infinity is different.	1
Pros- Great value for money- Camera quality is very good- Battery backup is also very good- Device performance is OK.- Display is good- Sound output is descent- Finger print performance is average- Look and feel of this device is goodCons- No fast charging support Overall this product is worth to buy at this price.	5
Received on 11th September great packing, super mobile with bezeless display, average battery one day battery backup, might have given 4000mah like MI phones other things great gives full ***** stars, except battery performance *** stars, lowest price but like Samsung. S8 display, butter smooth touch response.....great...thanks Micromax with super full vision display and Make in India mobile	5
I'm pleased with this product. In this price segment this phone holds much better performance. But the screen protector which has come in the box is not a good one but except this all is okay till now. Most important thing is that the front side and back side camera are perfect. Touch and fingerprint sensor is very responsive. no cons cz I hv not faced any in this phone. Good job Micromax. U can go for it surely.	5
WORST PRODUCTPoor Quality, Received defective product, Both the SIM cards are not detecting, Called Amazon, they are telling there is no Refund policy, I am just fighting with them...Never ever buy a product from AMAZONTHEY WANT TO CHEAT CUSTOMERS IN THE NAME OF POLICY....	1
superb phone camra quality is so good ...long battery backup totally good thax micromax good service by Amazon	5
Overall ok phone in this price range. Display is good but design is totally different as per image. It's not look like infinity phone only name is infinity. Otherwise features is good in this price. Battery capacity is low as per features. Display take too much battery .	3
Great mobile in this budget, good build quality, premium look, good full vision display with 18:9 ratio, good speakers.16 and 13 MP camera with real time bokeh effect is just aweome.	5
This a perfect mobile phone in this range.At the comparison of other phone like Nokia... Infinity made a boom.Specification of this mobile a better than Nokia because in this range it gave me everything which I want..so be thankfull to Micromax for build this mobile...	5
Looks, usage, UI, features all good..loved the mobile ...a good product in this range .	5
Nice and advanced product.	5
Worst phone  I have ever experience.Ui is slower than snail.camera is good.but performance wise it is worst	1
It's just been one day..working fine so far.battery is not really that big issue here.though the camera is good decent enough time lapse good..features looks are amazing..feels like iPhone x.. overall good.. Amazon app is hanging..let's see what happens tomorrow	3
Both sim slots are not detecting SIMspl take back product.and replace new one.Contact me	1
it lags a bit other wise this is complete bang for buks.also they have a interface like iphone ( completely depend on person to person perspective ) you might like it or not like it.	4
Great phone of this cost....	4
It is awesome smartphone in this range. Front camera quality is excellent and rear camera quality is good. Awesome screen 5.7 inch with ratio 18:9 without increase mobile size. Performing is also excellent with snapdragon processor and latest nougat android operating system upgradable with Oreo. Battery is enough for one day use for normal user but I feel not sufficient online user and gaming user.Overall Micromax done job excellent in this prize (Rs. 9,999) segment.Everyone should purchase this phone which want all in one in a smartphone.	5
I am writing this review after using this phone for 2 months.I love the phone and quality of both front and back camera's are very good it's fingerprint sensor also work good no issues right now  , it heats a little bit while playing games but it's ok but it gets little bit laggy when we turn on the internet but as compared to other phones in this price range it is better, it's infinity display actually gives a nice experience while playing games I can comfortably play Gangster Vegas which is approximatly 1.88gb game (after extracting) no issues. It has many sensors in the app called Smart kit 360 you can use every instrument in it.	5
Best selfies phone under 10000rs	5
Everything looks good, except Camera(Both). I have used Micromax Canvas earlier and it has 8 MP and i compared both and my old mobile is far better than the this.Performance is excellent, little heating while playing games and while charging.Full display is awesome with touch.Returned the product due to Camera issue. No Stock to replace now.	3
It's good phone but while playing music continues for 2hrs it start heating . That's why i am not happy with this product & when we take pic from normal camera and when i zoom that pic the pic starts getting blur & when we take pic while zooming the pic is not clear.	2
I will just say that Micromax has done a excellent  job by launching this infinity series...you won't get a good phone in this price range..the phone is really very user friendly and it's very good..You will get a different feeling while using this phone...the front camera is too good for selfies and primary camera is also very good..the ram management is also good.Overall I will just say that this is the best budget phone which I bundled with almost everything you need in your daily life..Good work guys @micromax India	5
Got my phone on 9dec. Satisfied with Amazon Delivery.Talking about phone. This is good phone in this price range. Good camera. Over all Buil Quality is good, But it's take too much time to charge this phone. That's one issue I had found that. Some heating problem.	4
I suggest to not buy because of heating problem and speaker and also screen colour was bad effect	1
Good mobile at the price of 9500/- but yes still need somethings to improve. Like notification panel is lacking. Finger print sensor only work 5 time out of 10. Back panel is having issue of finger prints on it so i had to laminate it.Camera is good, more than average. Speed is good. Screen quality is nice. Overall look is attractive and strong.	4
The phone goes way back with our fingers...hehe.just work on the camera and u are there	5
good product	5
This mobile is really so good. A very large and clear display. Battery life is so good and with stand for 2 days even for full internet and call usage. Very handy with Android 7 look so good user interface and icons. Really value for money.	4
It's OK. But the screen protector which came with the pack is smaller than the screen of the phone. And the phone has a mind of its own sometimes - it goes into refusal mode. I have to wait a while then give the commands. Processor seems a bit slow too. My spouse has a Lenovo K8 plus which is much better. Even the sound quality of Micromax is not so good.	3
It has a good design, Full screen visual, superb for selfie, battery back-up is nice. It's handy to carry.It would be better if the screen resolution is Full hd and processor of new version of snapdragon.Overall happy with the phone...	5
TRUE VALUE FOR MONEY. FINALLY GOT EVERYTHING IN SMALL PACKAGE OF JUST RS.9999/-.WITH AWESOME CAMERA FEATURES AND DISPLAY QUALITY IS REALLY "WOW"	5
Totally disappointed.	1
Very poor performance. I am extremely disappointed with this product as the only reason I bought this is cos its an Indian brand and wanted to promote it.	1
Very nice	5
Micromax really you did awesome work on canvas infinity.Really it's awesome phone	5
Very good phone and good utilazition of . Screen, battery and processor are amazing.	5
It's a good phone in the budget but some cons like ui is lagging a bit rear camera not as much as expected battery not so much efficient earphones out put of audio is bit unsatisfactory fingerprint is not so much accurate pros are screen ratio viewing angle is good build quality is premium.	3
I was using Micromax Canvas Nitro phone for the past three years without any issues. So I decided to buy Micromax phone again. Phone looks good. It is comfortable to hold even though screen size is big compared to my earlier phone (5 inch). Both the camera pictures are good and battery is easily crossing a day. So far so good.	4
good	5
The performance of this phone is not at all good as advertised by Micromax and battery gets discharged fast and is pathetic. Redmi phones are far better than Micromax.Not a good product to buy. Spending Rs. 9999 for this is not worth. Wasted my money.	3
This is the worst product i ever bought from amazon....nothing is good with this product..if any one tells me to rate its features then ill rate it as belowlooks  1/5performance  1/5battery  1/5camera  2/5although rate is less but still i suggest you all do not go for this product...	1
Amazing phone for very cheap price. Works awesome and I had no problem with this phone(writing this review for Canvas Infinity itself)	5
I feel so sad brought this because So many Failure... hanging...Auto re-start.......Tuch Not working Properly...Pl take Return and Provide another Good One	1
Worst phone.Worst touch screen.Don't buy.You'll regert.	1
Worth for this price tag.phone doesn't get heats up at all.Gave me 21hrs of battery backup with heavy usage.Camera quality is above average.	5
Working great and having nice features. Very good phone for moderate users. I was little skeptical to buy this phone after seeing the mixed reviews. But I am satisfied now after seeing it's features and performance. Got this phone at 7650 rupees on offer. Good deal for a full vision display phone...	5
The unit I received first had non-functional Finger Print reader. Don't know how it passed the Quality checks. Nevertheless, the replacement unit works great. Thought the low display resolution might be a hindrance but the display looks good. Camera quality and battery could have been better. Good for light to normal use.	4
Overall is good mobile at this price range.display and camera are awesomeBut it doesn't have gyroscope features you can not use VR HEADSET OR Google Street view app	4
I am giving my views after 3 weeks of use.1. I bought it because it was Indian.2. The battery lasts for more 24 hrs with Medium use. Whatsapp, FB, Twitter and calls and videos. It could have been better.3. The phone does not heat up.4. Audio quality is good. So is the camera. Nothing exceptional5. Value for money	4
Micromax has done a great job in providing a mobile with such good features for just 10000. Even though battery  life is decent but it's covered by features like bezel less screen, multiple window mode, portrait mode.Camera quality is good. The cost is really big advantage compared to other bezel less smartphone like lG q6.	4
I have apple 6 plus. Wht i found better den apple is finger sensor which is faster den apple and amazed. I would say the best phone in Just 10K.	5
Good device and all features what we want. I give 4 star because I don't like back, It is hard to open. Otherwise it is good mobile and it is better than oppo phone.But I don't like Mande In China things...	4
Good quality, great battery backup which I was thinking will be bad but thank God it is great. Display is awesome , Great phone in small budget	5
Seems only a boast of 3GB Ram and the processor. The phone hangs and is sluggish in performance. even hangs during the calls.	2
Good smartphoneIndian company did a very good workJust go for itI m using it since TuesdayGood things.....CameraRam 3 GBRoom 32 GB 26 GB usablePrice 9999User-friendlyVery good product in this price rangeBad thing....Charge very slowlyOverall the best phone in this price rangeAnd most important thing....This is from Indian brand....Be Indian buy Indian.....	4
One of the best in its class and a bit upset for hardcore gaming. Battery is good enough for 24 hrs.display and camera are excellent.	4
The camera quality is more than impressive and the latest version of Android, deliveres sweet performance.	5
Battery is not working 8 hours.. Files r not open properly mobile is hanging again an again an an main 5hing riten option is not showing when I purchase that time showing 15 day but now not showing what to do I have to riten this mobile I want money back	1
Amazing..... nothing can't say buy this phone and see everything.....	4
Awesome mobile , in rs 10000 ,a great bundles,if you think battery is low,but i can guarantee it will long lasting after rough use....main benefit no heating issue..during online multiplayer games or play while charging..	5
I was too much excited when I purchased it but after using 15 day I I'm disappointed coz  heating problem r there n hanging also ..some tym touch also not working... I did blender I reorder it for my mom ....not met as I expected..	3
Best phone in this price thanks micromax but it's screen gard is not so good it's color is just looks like yellow so it's better you order a screen gard	5
This device was no doubt had best specifications with low price but after using it for two months I am dissatisfied with it. Camera is not at all good. Lenovo/LG provide better camera.The software is not tested thoroughly it automatically scrolls up/down while searching for photo or contact and many more it not at all upto the mark.	2
Today I got my phone one side sealed sticker was already opened and I don't know if it's predownloaded apps but there is already apps like fb, asphalt, modijis app which normally v have to download later	3
Good phone for the price ,camera is very good,not good for hardcore gaming display isn't very bright or full HD ..should have been full HD 1080 resolution since it's 18:9 ratio. Works perfectly smooth, been using for 6 days tho.batterys is also good stays good over a day.Overall great phone very stylish.	4
Very very poor product and services by Amazon. After getting this mobile from Amazon I phase some technical issue that when mobile is restart, the mobile network not detect automatically in first time and for getting mobile network we have to restart is several time.Also phase a problem in last two days (from 23/12/2017) when any call comes in my cell the display automatically getting dark and nothing display as well as I am unable to pick call. For this I go on factory reset option but problems still happens.	1
Suitable for mild users. It has quad core processor+high quality plastic body=no heating problem.Low-lights images for both cameras are a bit disappointing, while in day light images are more acceptable. The front camera is awesome compared to other phones at similar price range.Battery does a great job, which is removable lithium polymer battery. Standby for almost 2 days, but no fast charging.	4
Really good,use super pixel mode to capture great photo.	5
Got it delivered on Wednesday. As soon as I started using it, it got hanged. From then it is working fine. Overall a good phone at this price range. After first day hang now it's working fine. User interface is good. Nice phone.  Finger print censor is weak.	4
Excellent phone in the price range 10000 ,I like everything like smooth ness, screen ,camera, etc everything is good in this range .	5
Excellent phoneExcellent service by Amazon. Ordered on 08/10/17 and received next day with out any extra charge. Using the phone since then. Excellent phone, excellent battery life, excellent sound quality. Only FM doesn't have RDS.Overall the phone is excellent.	5
Mind blowing set... Full touch display... I really like it	5
Don't buy this phone. Two major issues that I face :If you move from wifi data to sim data (VoLTE) you wont be able to make voice calls. In that case you have to either restart your phone or reactivate your sim. I face this issue on a daily basis. Horrible experience.Many a times touch screen just stops working.	1
This is the worst phone.I had bought this phone using no cost emi. Firstly i had replace due to technical issues. Second time I had got refund due to the same issue.  For this issues i have paid 1 month interest.	1
It's good phone in all features but some times hang and not displayed task bar and upper text of the phone... And after few minutes it shows automatically...	3
Phone is awesome, camera quality is excellent, easy to use and smooth touch. If u are not a hardcore game lover u must purchase this phone. I love it and no one gave this screen resolution in this price.	5
very good looking phone....i m normal game user so there is no any issue about laging.....and battery backup is quiet good according to their power.....camera quality is quiet good....so u can buy it.....	5

Thankyou Amazon for best Exchange Offer on my old mobile. This is my 3rd Micromax mobile from Amazon. Infinity is more than what i expected. Best Value for money. For those who use social networking, Photography, basic gaming this is for u guys. Don't expect high performance from under 10K budget.	5
Been using this phone for 3weeks, Display is good, once fully charged we can use it for more than a day,camera is simply awesome,looks quite premium as well ,it doesn't get hanged,after yureka black this one more killer from Micromax, kudos for that,will definitely recommend others to go for it	5
It is lagging after some time of use....battery is bad	3
I have been using this phone since first sale got released...i am satisfied with nice screen quality despite having hd resolution.. process should be 435 to work smoothly sometimes it feels little laggy. camera quality is avarage and build quality is good and feels premium...	4
Cute display very slim and weightless camera is excellent audio perfect good product from micromax 	5
Very very nice product in this price range. Super Selfi camera with good quality rare camera. Battery is quite good, with nice display and others features. I'm loving an Indian must go with it..	5
I purchased this mobile on 6th oct. and got delivere on 9th oct. Every thing in phone is great but after using the phone for one day i got issue in display. Whenever i use to call any number the phone screen got black and after call disconnect again it is fine. When i put complain a technician visited and created a folder Developer in setting and asked not to turn on this. Now the phone is working well.	4
I don't like this phone how can I return it give me feedback please I want to buy other phone it's performance isso bad	1
After one week experience -Pros--> design, edge to edge {18:9} display,  front camera is decent,  resemblence to samsung s8 from from front side so feels premium , ram management is also very goodCons--> processor which is most imp.  In a phone is comparativly on slower side. snpdrgn 425 is a outdated choice , 435 will be better one-> back camera and bokeh effect is nt up to mark	3
Sound is low.....But we can listen to it	4
What a features....it just amazing phone...I like the full vision display...2.5 D gorilla glass smooth touch ....charger of mobile is making such that while using supply never cut...and headset also good quality..... overall this Mobile is the year of the Mobile....thank you so much Micromax ...for giving us such a valuable Mobile......And as Micromax is a Indian company. ... that's the reason I brought this Mobile....Proud to be INDIAN	5

1) Display pixel and color looks pretty2) Performance is very good3) Mobile is slim and having good grip4) Front camera is more accurate5) Latest Android features	5
I have been using this phone for the last 10 days and it will assuage all ur needs nothing is to be worried about only battery is average and it will lags sometime after giving it simultaneous tasks.	4
Ok kind of product.... Front camera is good but rear camera is normal... Not so impressive... Using it from 4 days...feel heating on back... No other color is available.  Screen size is 5.7 but looks small in comparison to 5.5 size.	3
I was looking for a good Indian company smartphone since a long time. Micromax canvas infinity have fulfilled this. Though I cannot give 5 stars for the phone. But it deserves a 4 star and we should appreciate the efforts. Even though the phone currently is manufactured in China, sooner or later I hope we will match with the quality of Chinese manufacturer and start making quality phones.	4
Hi all,Recently, my phone has been having a problem with the proximity sensor during calls. When I finish a call, or want to look at my screen, the screen does not turn on by itself so I need to press the home button for the screen to light up. This is very annoying! I even turned off the option "Turn screen off during calls" (which is supposed to leave my screen lit up all the time) and the screen still goes black.Any suggestions would be very appreciated!NOTE: I am not using any case.	1
Excellent phone excellent price. Pro good camera, touch, speakers, loud speaker, full day battery,.	5
Best phone,Excellent Display,camera is also good .Worth Buy..	5
Very bad experience. Phone getting heated up and hanged up on regular basis. Will not suggest anyone to buy it	1
I loved it. Speacially the front selfie camera,and the multi tab function. Best "Smart Phone" true worth for money. Very good features and design under 10k segment..	5
Good mobile front camera gud and both camera s are gud. But internal storege given only 22 gb. Battery backup 6 hours on internet and otherwise phone is beautiful	4
I would have given 5 stars If I wasn't facing this issue. Nothing is in there 'themes'. That is empty showing 'List is empty'. And the UI of notification panel is quite laggy... Although the phone is a charmer in itself! With superb look and UI. Similar to Samsung Galaxy S8 plus. With good battery backup I would say and no heating issue... I guess it's worth it! Blockbuster in budget!	4
No good phone ....Bekar he	1
Worst smart phone by this company... As always... So many lags. Errors ... Already faced display problem within 2 months . Please don't buy.. waste of money.. and the main thing micromax said was that this phone will get latest Android updates very soon... Its been a year.. i haven't received any major update.	1
Insufficient User guide is supplied,which does contain necessary information for a layman and which is not very useful. How am I to get directions for my doubts? Otherwise the mobile seems to be OK.	4
Recived on 11/11/17 !bugs In some apps!!hangs atleast one time a day n have to remove battery n restart it!!seems like micromax sacrificed performance for looks!also  fast draining of battery when compared to others!touch sensitivity low!thinking of giving ph to service centre!	1
Great phone at gud price....	5
I am in love with Micromax. Infinity is really good. and I am happy using this.	5
Well a nice phone for Casual use but.this phone is not good Enough for gaming not as Games lag on This phone but Battery is Lil Bit Low gaming.Else Good camera, attractive Look And Smoth . if you r buying It For Non gamers Than u Should go for it .	4
Ordered this mobile 4 days back. Amazon delivery is prompt & at the right time.Regarding Mobile, after 4 days usage I have observed these:- Battery Backup is the major problem. Battery is draining like anything once u browse through mobile.- 5.7" screen doesn't look like so.Apart from above two points... Mobile is worth buying!!!	4
very bad mobile , charging was not continuously stand bycgarging capacity is very badnow my phone is switched off , what i will do, my phone doesn't taken charging	1
Value for money. Under 10k it is a good phone good camera quality good design sorry very good design. One missing. It is not a full HD display overall good mobile.	4
Go For It.Be unique and Be Forward.EveryOne is Looking for a Good phone. It is Somehow a Good phone for sure.Don't Judge it by it's Name. It's really a Good Product from Micromax.Jai Mahismati. Jai Micromax.	5
Awesome Indian made mobile at this price. Super battery backup, quick charging of 30-40% in 15 min, no heating problem like earlier mobiles, unbelievable selfies with 16 MP cam... worth buying at this lowest cast.. I just loved it. Thank you Micromax.	5
Absolute value for money. This phone can be compared to the looks and feel of a premium phone. Good features and commendable battery life. Keep it up Micromax	5
One of wrost phone in my purchase life nothing good with this hanging,heating,battary everything wrost now I came why Micromax lost his place	2
Very bad for use. Hanging problem. Networking problem, internet connectivity problems.	1
Phone has lag of few seconds, battery should've been a bit more. Rest is okay with the phone. Thought Micromax is amnufactured in India and bought the phone. It is made in China.	3
Very Good Product Nice Mobile Micromax Canvas Infinity Thanks Amazon..!	5
Worst product. Within two days started auto shutdown and dead mode only the red led indicator at top right side. Referred to care centre but no use, finally sold with scrap value.	1
Phone not working properly.  It's nott been even 1 month their is mang problems in the phone. Worst product . Amazon please refund amd take your product.	1
Lot of hang issue, inbuilt email not found, inbuilt browser not found, inbuilt document viewer not found, lot of videos not support and more huge problem.	1
Micromax did good job here,a little OS optimisation is required, hope we will get it soon in next updates. No matches in this price range.Thank you amazon for excellent service as always.	5
Awesome phone at this price range, I bought it on 1st of spetember and after around 1 month of use I can definitely say that this phone is great.Gr8 lookz, Camera is superb, Battery is ok ok, and I didn't felt any laggs or issue.	5
Nice product	5
Phone was awesome. I bought it in its first sale. If you ignore below points:1. Data is used even when Data is turned off. This might have been resolved from their software update.2. Screen brightness is low and screen visibility is low under sunlight.3. High end games do lag and is noticeable.	4
Phone is very good looking...Nice nice...Performance is also good...buT the fingerprint sensor not works sometimes....All over is good....Headphone are not good get damaged in 1 week only pls help regarding it amazon....	4
Budget smartphone for mediocre users!!	5
Worst product. Trying to use it for six months. Absolutely wastage of money. No performance, no service centre. Please don't go for any micromax product.	1
Superbbbb phone really  Micromax good work	5
I got my phone and what I thought how it would be was it was more good than that. The full display is even more interesting and the features are amazing!	5
After used 6 month .this phone got hung and laoding sim contact every time .poor phone	1
This fone is very sleek and classy. It is very professional, with all the basic important feature in it. I love the way they pack, and deliver the product with quick delivery. The fone has most of the best features for a desirable fone, but I only noticed a few things in the quality of sound and video, which is less. Other than that.. it's worth buying.	4
Amazing experience at low cost....! Worth buying it....!	5
Very good display. Super battery backup. Fast performance	5
Within 2 days it is giving problemRear camera is not good as compair to 13 mpIts hang too muchFingerprint not work it accept anyonce finger and phone gets unlockFully disappointed by this phoneRecommended not to buy it smart phone	1
Very poor.Just 3 months since I purchased it and battery weak and not working	1
WhatsApp connectivity problem is there need to restart mobile every time it gets disconnected tried all possibilities unable to resolve this, unwanted notification are popping up and unable to disable them, mobile gets hanged some times, camera is good	2
No gyroscope, cannot use vr headsetContacts photo are blurry whenever we call and whenever we receive calls, bad product, do not buy it	1
Camera quality is zero.....its only showing big MP else its same as 3 MP	1
Mobile look is good and camera image quality bis poor and it's discharging pretty quickly and even the user interface is made to look better on ad and not to the level of MI BRAND ALSO can't believe where Micromax is headed from here	2
Good product, only charger is not proper and it is not charging phone. I have to use my old charger. I was expecting product which has screen size bigger in width but it is bigger in height. But no problem with performance so far.	4
Exacalant phone for 9999, battery, sound,camera,screen,touch and every thing is super. Awesome...... Super product I really thank to Micromax to introduce this kind of phone.	5
Product dosen't work as of now. I want to return this product. It is hardly 15 days since I purchased this product.	1
Delivery by Amazon was fast and on the clock. But the product is bad. First, it's completely a Chinese phone, nothing Indian. Both cameras are pathetic.  Slow processor.  I am shocked how Micromax can come into the market with such a pathetic phone. Go for Nokia-3.Rakesh	1
Micromax canvas infinity is good phone.camara good picture clarity both cameras. No heating and battery good.sound is very good clarity.	5
I ordered a canvas Infinity. Amazon delivered a defective piece. The phone only worked when it was connected to a charger. Didn't know I'd get a landline when I specifically ordered a cellphone. I filed a replacement request. Guess what. Amazon delivered another defective piece with the SAME ISSUE! What chicanery is this! I'd give minus 5 stars if I could!	1
Best ever phone from the house of Micromax. Specially its Portrait mode features while taking photos is a unique feature. Only iPhone X have this feature which cost 1 lac and Micromax have provided these features only within 10K	5
I have satisfaction with this phone but some times its lag and when I click on bottom, it opens otherside apps. when i play some games on it sometime lags and heats up fast. You can see the unboxing video of Micromax canvas infinity on my YouTube channel Manik Arora tech videos. 3 stars for delivery and for processor. BATTERY life is good as compared as others	3
One of the best mobile in that price range....good camera ...and also Snapdragon 425 ....	4
Phone look is grant	5
It's been three days now that I have used the phone. I have to say Micromax really did a good job this time by providing a high quality phone with premium looking features & better camera &  battery back up. I have used four Micromax phones till date starting from Aisha to Canvas 6 excluding this one and battery & camera features were always unsatisfactory in those compared to other similar priced smartphones.This has an excellent camera but I would prefer the 16 Megapixel camera be provided at back rather than front because I am not much of a selfie person. Battery capacity is enough to last a complete day with average usage like whatsapping, surfing & the phone does not have much of a heating issue.Call quality has also improved from previous Micromax phones and VOLTE calls are clear & sharp.Only thing I feel a little unsatisfied about is the display. After using Canvas 6 which had a DPI of 403, this one feels a little paler compared to Canvas 6 as it's DPI is around 318.But considering the price of  10000 & host of other features that is being provided, this flaw can be ignored. Those upgrading from lower end budget phones, the lower DPI will not be a flaw at all.I have provided one low light shot taken using the Super Pixel feature in rear camera to give an idea of the camera quality.	4
this device is not so much good as I expected. there has many problem with this mobile. it is becoming too hot when I charge it. the videos cannot be save on youtube. everytime it needs to redownload. I am not satisfied. I want to change this device as I bought this with exchange offer . but I cant. the return window has closed everytime.	1
Volume drop down and mute automatically while using headphones	1
Camera quality is good serious hanging problem is there. Figer sensor also does work well. I replaced it with MI phone and that was not the right desiscion. An indian company will become out of the market if they are unable to compete	3
Awesome phone with great features,Thanks Micromax	5
It's great phone, performance and new features worth of money bt there is prblm that this phone is made in china. The owner of micromax should make this phone in our country INDIA and thnx to  Amazon for fast delivery	4
This is not a good phone because battery backup is not good and music player sounds is very bed loo and year phone is also bad sound just like a local Street product sound..... I'm Totally waste of money for this product...	1
Very bad product, don't waste money in buying this. When I try to dial a number it is not responding. Worst camera, poor processor.Waste waste waste!!!only good thing in the phone is front camera.	1
If compare to price this Phone is good. But some time notification are come that time mobile suddenly hang.	4

Super Phone and value for price, I am amazed by Micromax Infinity and planning to get another one in next sale.	5
Good displayBattery goodCamera perform well in daylightPoor night vision cameraHangs sometimes	5
What a phone nice cool mobile and camera quality is very nice and its display very nice buy this product nice products...	5
just awesome phone at this price range only small problem is that the snapdragon 425 is little slow but ot can be neglected taking in view the other facilities given at this price range.......	5
Very very poor camera and product quality wise dear all please do not purchase this mobile.... Very bad product amozone tell me this product is very excellent product............ But this is fake product	1
Great phone in budget love to shape weight etc. Phone speaker is very bad sound is not clear to hear specially when i play vedio. Touch is gud but not very gud littil slow, clarity is gud. Over all this is a budget phn to buy. Gadget lover don't Buy this they have disopinted.	3
Aisa dhasu or super camera phone Aj tak apne life me pahle kv nahi dekha .super camera and display was oowesome	5
Phone is worth on this price	5
NOT AS EXPECTED MICROMAX IS POOR	3
I used in 45 days in this mobile.very good for normal uses.both cameras good for this price range mobiles.no heating issues.ok for battery.not recommended gaming and heavy users.better than China mobiles.only con is no updates.	4
I like the product design, UI,Performance. Everything is good. It would be great if battery capacity is more	5
Performance is very poor. If Micromax wants to serviwe in market. You have give good quality product.	1
Really worth the money. Its the perfect choice where customer enjoys latest features without investing in costly brands. Inside box, everything was intact as described in listing.	5
Nice mobile, no problem still and responses fast. Finger print sensor works awesome.	5
It was a complete disaster to buy Micromax infinity, the phone gets hanged every moment and very slow, the touch screen is very bad and over all performance is a complete disaster	1
All is Good but something slow phone .	4
Doesn't feel like 3GB Ram. The touch is not good at all. The finger print unlock sometimes doesn't work. The phone gets hanged and you have to restart it.	2
It is a excellent phone in 9999 light weight and good thing is that u get protective case and screen guard absolutely free and experience with amazon is excellent and mind blowing	5
This product is an average phone ! Please only buy if you seriously want a phone ! Becuase the camera is awful and display is so bright that you cant even identify the color	2
Pros. Very good look, dedicated memory card slot, 18:9 aspect ratio display, light weight, removable battery and promise to upgrade latest Android security patch and Android oreo.Cons. Battery capacity less than 3000 mah, no quick charge support.	4
Very nice mobile.. infinity display supab... excellent build quality.. fine camera...2900 mah battery but good charge service... Overall best in 9999 rs... I very very like it...	5
Found it better when compared to other Micromax phones. Not sure how it is good when compared to other brands because I haven't used them. Quality of this phone is really good.	5
Used it for almost 10-12 days, pretty fast and light in hand. No lagging, low signal or battery drainage as seen in some rating seen (not a heavy user). A great phone inside 10k budget 	5
LOTS OF TIME WHATS UP IS NOT STARTING THEN I HAVE TO REBOOT THE PHONE. EVEN TOUCH IS ALSO NOT GOOD. BATTERY POWER IS REALLY GOOD. BUT NO OTHER INBUIT APPLICATION ARE THR	1
Just got it yesterday..just one day old but I am satisfied as per the camera quality or Facebook live video is very clear and sounds music quality also good..YouTube sound could have been louder but that doesn't matter and other staffs like battery and all is also good..I am satisfied till now...display size or color contrast is also impressive..everything is good...like for this..	4
Awsm smartphone	5
Maybe my expectation was little high with this device. They are having good product in this price range. Camera is good, but not the best in this price range	4
Good Smartphone at this price and I hope Micromax will give Android Oreo update in future	5
Camera is bad quality  not like 13 mp and 16 mp just like 5 mp rear camera and 8 mp front camera but process is good and designed is perfect no doubt but camera is very bad	3
In this price range,no other brand got such an excellent camera(both),specially selfie camera.....But processor is slow compare to redmi and other competitive brand.....Display is killer......Not made for hardcore gamers.....Battery performance is average.....	4
Nice mobile handle softly pictures quality is nice	5
Had touch screen issues twice. Got to remove the battery completely to make it work again.Rear camera is not worthy for 10k.Display and feel is good	3
Good mobile with good h/w in MicromaxBut some times it's working slowly	4
The Bokeh effect on rear camera is somewhat poor if compared with MI A1.Front is OK.Otherwise Camera Quality is satisfactory.A good phone in this budget.If you want a decent camera quality phone,go for it.	4
Worst camera quality ,camera is not worth even rs 2000.i just want to return this phone but amazon provides no return policy ,i really hate it.its a big fraud to get money from the customers n then making them helpless later on by providing no return policy	1
Best phone in this budget	5
everythng is good for this phone..except its finger print sensor..it does nt work properly	4
Amazing mobile. Not any bad comments. Just one problem I feel this mobile it's a hang in only one day usage. I am not installed any app recently in this mobile.	3
I have purchased before 2 day ago, but I feel this is good phone ram and rom is good, but minor issue may be occurred i.e. Battery. It seems that the battery backup not so much, phone discharge rapidly. Rest good.	4
At this price range this phone is very good with most of the features available in any other high end phones.battery back up is good.phone doesn't get heated up quickly.overall feedback about this phone would be "very good'	4
I bought this mobile on first sell. In this product a minor issue is that if you install another launcher for personalised your phone your mobile should be hang	4
I brought  this mob  last month  but now suddenly dead without any  damage  I really dissatisfied with this  brand ....	1
product add and original prudact is like day and night differences and brightness is very low. all time need to full.and i have another charging problm with my phone..	1
Phone is awesome... You can buy it without any doubt... But battery is draining fast just one negative point...	5
It is a very good phone compared to price of the phone. It also has blur effect on background while capturing photos just like DSLR camera.	5
Phone is very nice... Nice features as they have said!Very good Camera quality.	5
Good product guys u like this phone,touching quality is so smooth and fingerprint scanner is also work smoothly, guys you never face hitting and hanging problem in this phone so I I like this phone in Rupees 10000 only lovely phone by Micromax .	5
Sorry to inform I am using Micromax Canvas infinity mobile from past 3 months Selfi camera is not working ...I don't know what is the issue this problem occured after Micromax version update.	2
This was my 3 mobile of micromax brand in last 5 years it was a very Good product at this price better than many Chinese brands like opo vivio goine etc who are selling not on quality but on forced advertising.Be Indian buy Indian	4
Screen locks repeatedly and restore only when battery is removed.Wrote to micromax but no response.Purchase on own risk	1
Awesome  phone with low budget..  people must go 4 it rather than vivo ir oppo.Cz itz provides a good selfie camera plus infinity display..	5
It's a worst product...don't buy it..very bad experience with this phone .. no accessory available in market till now.. i suffer after buy this phone	1
Medium quality	3
Micromax canvas infinity is better phone,front camera,back camera,and battery life is superb I LOVE IT	5
it is having mother board problem with in package itself ...i am looking to return it to the amazon but i didnt seen return option	1
Data cable of the handset is defective and not working. Hence kindly replace it.	1
Camera and display quality is too good, but finger print sensor doesn't work or about 10% success unlocked condition	3
Just awesome, Just Buy it you will get everything in 10K Mobile. Thanks Micromax and Amazon for this product.Cloudtail, you are doing well pls go ahead!!	5
Phone is good but earphone not working properly right side speaker volume is to low and if i touch earphone jack thn left speaker also not working	3
Nice phone. Nice display pretty fast worth the price I have seen many negative comments about the speaker volume that is wrong the speaker display is worth the pricr a must buy phone with 10k.range thanks Micromax	5
Phone book isn't working properly one contact get saved 3 times automatically	3
Look wise the mobile is Good but voice quality is very bad. Its just 2 months since i purchased. It doesn't work good in loudspeaker. Its microphone is damaged.	1
Rating this phone's features out of 5....after using this phone for last one month.....1.looks -because of full vision display----- 5points2.battery-2900 mAh battery-------4.5points3.sound-quite loud and clear----4.5 points4.camera-16mp front camera----5 points5.screen-5.77 cm--4.5 point..6.gaming----not good for gaming----3 points7.heating problem---little ;----3points	5
Pros:Very nice UI. Easy to use.Fast response UI.Bezel less view is awesome especially when you watch a photo or video in 18:9 full screen.Both Camera are good. Day photography with 18:9 resolution is just cream.Timelapse really works well. I have tested 5x and 10x. Have to get some time to test 300x.Selfie is awesome. It's wide angle selfie, you  should select a good background to get a nice view selfie.Panorama is quite wide angle and covers a very good height comparable to my Moto G3. Looks very nice, does not look like photo joined unlike other phones.Phone does not heat much. No heating while internet download even on a moving vehicle.Display of the phone is bit reddish which makes videos/movie very attractive. You will enjoy.. although the resolution is 720p, but the quality is good. Pictures look sharp when you watch a movie. I have compared with Moto G3, OnePlus 5 and Yunicorn.Day to day operation is quite smooth and lag free.Using the Finger Print sensor is a charm. It instantly unlocks the screen.Battery will easily last 2 days with normal use. For me it lasts 1.5 days with moderate use of internet. Even with heavy usage you can carry throughout the day.Con: 1080p display was better for the competition, but again it needed more battery.Camera quality in low light is not impressive. But in this range I did not find better than this. Tested Xiaomi Note 4, Yunicorn and Moto G3.Build Quality could have been better. I wanted strong edges like Moto G3.Corning Gorilla glass is missing. Although it has become common in new phones still I want Gorilla glass protection.	5
This is a best phone in 9999 camera is superb it is loking a primum phone in your hand infnty display add a swag in this phone thanku micromax	5
exellent performance for this price ragegood displayexellent camera bothblindly go for it manits worth for mny	5
Nice product by Micromax. No need to think twice before buying.	5
good phone but hanging problem,some times touch not working,finally good for money,competitor for mi phones	4
Hanging Problem. Whatsup wont working properly. Camera is good. Battery could have been better. Cont even exchange with other mobile if u dont want this mobile. you wont get replacement. worst service by Amazon.	3
Poor camera quality, if we give WiFi hotspot in few minutes it gets heat. On call if we put on loud speaker the another person will not able to hear our voice. This phone is not even listed for the exchange on Amazon if we want to buy another phone for exchange..	1
The phone is great for it's price,The only concern that I've observed in it was that it's UI is laggy but a launcher can solve that problem.And since I've been using it for about a couple of months it is a nice phone.	3
Very bad experience with this mobile .. Very poor performance..Camera not even working properly.. Got mobile on 11th sep 2017 within 25 days my mobile experience is worse than anything.. Pls dont watse your money.	1
The battery performance is awsome, but small issue with mylauncher	4
Im not satisfied with this model.. often the phone is getting hanged and touch is not working properly. Everytime, i either have to switch it off or reboot the mobile. Really Iim getting irritated with this phone. Please don't sell it via these websites..	2
Definately go to go phone within budget... purchased 10days ago	5
Ok satisfied achha phone h but fingers print scanner is not fast working and some time hanging. Is Price range me achha h	4
In this price segment no one other to compete.Both camera good	5
Fantastic Phone from Micromax, if you want Stylish phone under 10k, go with Canvas Infinity.Review after using 15 days.	5
Excellent phoneBought this phone to show my patriotism.	5
Camera is fine, lite weight and looks wise is also good.The back side panel look poor, as its made of plastic.Rest its good phone	4
Using since 7 days no problems , no lags , and yes the camera is way excellent in this price range , 3 gb ram enables a good multitasking, in just 10000 this is a complete package. Go for it 	5
It's Hanging from the very first hour ..But Everything is good except it ..Specially The front camera 	3
Pros: no heating issueCons: Battery backup not good	3
Pros :. + good battery back up + sleek and slim + non hybrid sim slotCons: -- average display -- sluggish performance	3
Value for money. Everything fine except the launcher crashes sometimes. Camera quality ok. Front camera performs better than rear one.	3
Rest is good it's just phone is getting banged at least 2-3times a day. Need to reboot every time	4
unboxing & reviews - Best budget smartphone under 10k	4
It looks a premium phone.Awesome design, Bright and bigger screen , Good touch . Good camera specially selfie , camera features are also good.Multitasking is good, I did not checked for games which required very high performance.For me it is an excellent mobile.	5
Low sound volume , back camera quality low, no cam scanner	1
Good for medium cost phone. Quite slow in operation, photos are dull in night time, taking more time for full charging..	4
It's OK. Restart is required once in 2 to 3 days.	4
It's a great product by Micromax!!! Nicely designed, display is very pretty and smooth.. processor is great.. overall it's a 'Dhamakedaar' mobile phone in this price range!!!	5

Honest review...I was mi note 3 user.  So I am writing on that mobile compare basis....1. Even mmx have snapdragon.. It's slow that mi. Slow opening of app, slow transition etc.2. Battery  2900 mah works preety good.3. Screen is good, but clarity is less than mi.4. Image shown on box of mmx is fake. Mobile is of different look.5. Front camera is 100% more good than mi note 3.6.back camera is also better than mi.7. Sound quality is little low than mi note 3. It's ok ok.8. Overall mmx have done a good job.9. Ui is also ok but still need little work.10. It's not as user friendly as mi.11. U can buy it.. 10 k is ok priced.12. Both have there own feature.13. Ignoring screen clarity, everything seems good in mmx. Satyam suresh singh 9118444999	3

This phone could have been better if it had 16:9 aspect ratio as well. Rear camera doesn't seem to be 13mp even when kept in 13M. It's more like 8M. And Micromax should have given a full HD display. Also, dual speakers with Dolby Atmos would have made it sound much better.I am updating my review. This phone keeps rebooting. There was an update of software recently from Micromax. But the problem is still there. The loudspeaker is of very poor quality. The rear camera does not perform like a 13 megapixel. It is more like a 5 megapixel. The front camera is 16 megapixel but what is the use? The charger that came with the phone is a slow charger.  It takes ages to charge the phone. Much better phones are available in the market in this price range.	1

Worst product I yet seen...	1
I have been using this phone for last couple of days and found it to be good enough for an average user.Full vision dsiplay is the main highlight.You will find it great while playing videos and games.Performance wise, it has given me an amazing experience as it has never lagged or hung.Handling wise its premium. Looks wise it is amazing.For 10k, its a great buy. I dropped the idea of buying Nokia 6 after looking at it.You can see the number of Applications I have installed and its performing well.Think and save your hard earned money.	5

Guys after using 1 month here is the review ,Good battery, full view screen, great selfi camera, good primary camera, 32 gb,3 gb ram , no heating issue, good model, no weightAll are for 10,000 only,  so good in budget.Moreover proudly say this is made in India, of course some parts imported from China as online reviews says. But anyway one company hardly trying to compte with rest of this world & they almost there. Hope all the best to Micromax team , hope they would compete apple. With in 10,000 they can provide us like this best phone, if we would give chance just imagine for 80,000 they can make it miracles.So guys I request you first brand your India business I mean first respect & value , believe our products, I am dam sure that days are not more far away one day world buy & prefer our products. And all that can be happen with your support guys. So please brand and proudly say this is our product.By the way this is third product from Micromax which I bought. I am not fan of Micromax but believe me I prefer because those products which  I bought & used from Micromax all are still in good condition & didn't get any trouble apart from very very small issues but at the same which I used & bought from other brand products, faced heating issues , hanging issues, battery down issues. This is true, I respect geninue why should I take that product which is not good. Just think.	5

Fine display and battery backup . Camera not good quality	4
Best thing is it's awesome screen to body ratio is excellent very much better than LG Q6, for those who want better rear camera can select super pixel option in camera settings it gives very good zooming details, battery backup for 2900mah is quite decent. Only the back look is not good it could have been like other not like XIOMI.Very light weightCONS720P display...After update the system update button in the strings stopped working.	5
Pros:- 1- Best camera 2-ifinity display3-metal designCons:- 1-average battery2-720p display not full hd3-no fast chargerOverall best phone value of moneyIn 10k	4
Though MICROMAX IS A INDIAN company but it's  @@@NOT MADE IN INDIA@@@....WHEN I RECEIVED MY PHONE ON THE BOX IT IS MENTIONED AS @@@@MADE IN CHINA@@@ which is ridiculous. If I would have known that I'm getting a made in CHINA phone then I would have opted for CHINESE company phones only... after seeing this label MADE IN CHINA.I even went to sell this phone  but no one was ready to buy it  coz redmi is available for them at 7K only.I expected  this mobile to be MADE IN INDIA & not made in elsewhere.1.Sometimes phone is acting weird(hanging) unable to operate anything need to restart phone in order to use the phone, now a days it's becoming a regular task.2. Unable to pickup incoming calls also at times, even today I have faced this problem.3. All of a sudden some apps stop working.Hope these comments would have some impact on the maker of the phone.	1
Hello everyone,This phone looks awesome.Better features than LG Q6,which are missing in Q6 like notification light,cast screen,big display,bundled accessories back cover can be opened.Yes its it's display is low but manageable.Regarding front camera in indoors pics looks yellowish,but outdoor is great.Back camera is okay.Suddenly notifications are coming like playing tone, balance low.It needs to be rectified in next update.Battey is okay.Only Gyroscope is missing.Double tap to switch off display is not working.Games are playing okay.Its processor is low but manageable for moderate users.All in all it's good phone according to it's price range.	4
Awesome front camera ...Great back camera at low light and advance feature in one step ...Display quality is great in price under 10 kBattery given 2900 mah...but it look like 4000 mah thankx to Micromax..Mobile has premium feel which no one will give in segment...No  lagging at any stage ...Infinity is really infinity ...feel proud on Micromax ..Hope that also launch more infinity with advance 18:9 ratio...Verdict .... Without thinking go for it...Prem	5
value for money	5
Great phone from Micromax, Hearlty congrats to everyone who trusted and brought the phone.Likes:1. Display as promised very fine finished.2. Speaker volume is good and best .3. No heating issue over calls or while charging.4. Even though there is no quick/fast charging the time take to fully charge is around 2 hours and considerably good. 1.5 days of battery availability with silent battery saver.5. UI mode is a mirror copy of iphone which looks good.6. Camera is best of best ,  front cam with flash, Autofocus works exactly as in reviews over youtube.7. Phone is thin and less weight.8. No lag while using, With my previous phone redmi note 3 over multiple usage of apps there was sluggish in usage.Drawback or something which could have improved.1.quick charging2.Could have manufactured in India promoting make in India.3. Dual cam could have captured the depth of the image like in evok.	5
Working good.satisfied with the product as I expected.Headset has excellent bass and ultimate music clarity.Display quality is also good and it's quite large compared to budget mobiles in this range. Camera quality for both front and back good for  this range.It has also long battery backup. Totally performance wise good product to purchase.	4
I ordered this phone on 1st September flash saLe. I have a Samsung. Phone screen is big enough to do all multimedia stuff. Definitely not bulky. Good front camera for selfie. Should have given 16mp same camera at the back. A good phone for 10k rs. Connectivity is good.wifi works great. Don't compare to s8 or iPhoneX . In this budget you are getting a best deal. Also I was looking different colors. Which micromaX needs to think about. Also increase battery size.	3
To be honest, The phone worked fine and i liked the performance except for the UI lag.But the touch screen at some portion stopped working after 15 days of usage. No breakage of parts from my side. Low quality parts including touch screen and display, is used. When I called and asked micromax service care for a replacement, they said that they don't bknow anything and told me to contact service center. And when I visited the service center, they said it will take 1 week for replacement of parts for a brand new phone and said there will not be any replacement. One of the worst customer care I have seen. Bad phone and even worse customer care. I suggest u to go for some other phones at this price range. Or buy it at your own risk.	1
hello,recently i have ordered micromax canvas infinity HS2 from Amazon and suddenly after 2-3 days this phone got hanging but we ignored but now the problem persists and its touch is not working. we want to open contacts it is opening amazon or any other appvery disappointedplease exchange this phone or make this problem solvereply fast	1
This phone has a pretty look. Front Camera quality is superp,thankfully it has front flash too. Though it doesn't support  turbo charge battery performance is good.No heating problem till now.But only bad thing is user interface it is comparatively bad and have to  improve..	4
Best phone under 10k, by..by Chinese,Me micromax ke bohut friend you..Good job micromax.....My favorite mobile company	5
A good featured phone after a long time from Micromax.Pros-1- Works properly, no hanging problem.2- finger print sensor is quite good.3- Good battery life.4- split screen feature provides two apps to run simultaneously on your screen5- sound quality & display is good.Cons-1- front camera is not up to mark.2- not suitable for hardcore gamers.3- takes around 3 hours to charge from 0-1004- overpriced5- Micromax is an Indian company but the product is made in China	3
Performance and quality isn't as good as it seems to be, phone lags too much, build quality is very cheap. Overall all I can say is this phone looks like the retarded cousin of Samsung Galaxy S8 and performs like the retarded cousin of Galaxy S8.	1
Hi,I bought Micromax Canvas Infinity and sharing this review on my personal use.Micromax Canvas Infinity comes with a price tag of Rs. 9999/- mid range with great specs and that's the very first thing that attracts consumers.3 Things I personally like about this phone:1. Design- This phone features an infinity display which itself catches all the attention, again looking at the entire design Micromax has done a great job here giving it a slick look, feels really good and light weight in hand.2. Sim/Memory- It has a dual sim and  also supports microSD card up to 128GB. So i don't have to switch between sim and microSD card. It houses 32 GB of internal storage with 3 GB RAM, not to forget it also supports OTG which gives additional storage for your media.3. Front camera- 16 MP with a front flash has a pretty decent quality and the camera app which has inbuilt beautify modes make it more appealing.3 Things which disappoints about this phone:1. Performance- Unlocking the phone is really slow. It take its own time to unlock which after using for a while gets annoying. Switching between cameras is slow; whereas i didn't have any difficulty in switching apps. So its a mid performance phone.2. Battery- This phone has a removable battery of 2900 mAh, which I find to be not enough for heavy users even if you are only using it for internet browsing.3. Display- No full HD display.Over all, Not to forget this phone comes under Rs.10000/- and comparing it with other product I find it to be pretty impressive at this price band .My experience with this phone was pretty good.Please leave comments below if this was helpful.Thanks for reading.	5
I book this mobile no 1st of September and I get it by 4th of September. In this price one of the best mobile from my point of view . Highlight is  quality it was really sooooooo good. All r telling in this budget MI is best but my point of u Infinity is best thanks to Micromax. But only 2things r little bad1st I can't able to use mobile in sunlight plzzz improve the brightness2nd u can improve battery is really importantOther then it's really good and packing also super thanks to Amazon	4
Only condition which u don't have to go for this phone is .. only if u r a heavy gamer... , if u want above average speed with large display.. it not infinity display..  Rest camera ,battery, overall new operating system, screen resolutiom, volume, accessories along with phone, handling, all in all its a great package for price.. preloaded camera software is fun to experiment with and front flash does the low light photo possible... Battery is above average know ...All my friends are dispointed coz of Micromax .. coz of its after sale service, let's hope it resovles issues quickly coz it's a popular saying .. Micromax Canvas last max for a year.  Hope Micromax improves its after sale services or built phones for lasting longer.	5
Best Smartphone in Budget .proud to indian company black colour in fabulous .but one senser missing gyroscope senser i hope Micromax next smartphone complete in All sensers but phone is okay	4
This phone is quite good with its specification. But i don't know why it got hanged so badly it is not even reboot. I can't see notification tab, even if i try to slide down it. I buy this phone because it is an indian company and i believe everyone should promote indian brands instead of china products. Back cover is very hard to remove. First you will not understand how to remove back cover which was quite funny to find. Then i saw everything inside was made by china. Somewhere i felt this and requesting micromax to start manufacture all the products in india instead of taking it from china. Now i will show this phone to service centre. Lets see how they respond it. But think before you go for this.	2
Hi, its been more then 1 week of use..its a genuine review after use of 1 week.Pros:Best camera at this costFinger print is fine (considering the fact that we are not launching atom bomb or rocket through finger print)Screen size is really big24*7 service and replacement warrantyStock androidRemoval batteryViewing angle are decent3gb ram 32 GB internalNow cons:Battery could have been 4000 mah which is decentProcessor could be octacore 625 or 630This is not a full HD deviceYou tube will support only 720 pixel videoFinally the product is for normal users camera is best with optimum battery. The phone is not ment for hardcore gamers. If you are a hard core gamer then go for redmi note 4.Thanks	5
After Using 4 month I found 2 CONS.1.SlowProcessor  onlyIf you are heavy gamer than it not for you. And2.Slow Finger print sensor.Rest of all features are very good.Both Camera and sound Superb.Premium look and big full view Screen.Budgeted Phone	4
Superb mobile in this price range . Really love it . Camera is awesome. Smart handset . Love it. Recommended to all of u guys. Micromax really done a good job with this mobile ..	5

It's a very good phone - go for it without any second thought. Camera quality is ok and have been using it from last 1month and it never hangs. Battery discharging is as per usage. There are times when the charge lasted for more then 30 hours.	5
This review may help people who gonna buy this mobile on 8th september :pPROS :-No Heating Problem - The best thing I love in this phone is there is no much heating, I had played some heavy games like Dungeon Hunter 5, Brothers in Arms 3, Future Fight, Mortal Kombat X etc., for more than a hour but I didn't feel much heat.Camera Quality - Camera quality(16mp front and 13mp rear both flash) is good at this price, I'm very much impressed with some effects like Portrait and Timelapse.Display - 5.7" screen with 720x1440 pixels resolution has both pros and cons. Eventhough it has 5.7" screen mobile smaller than many other 5.5" smartphonesOS - Latest Android Nougat 7.1.2, with some smart actions & smart gestures, "OK GOOGLE" works perfectly. :PFinger Print - Finger Print sensor is pretty fast than the most Lenovo and Moto phones.Charging - Charging Time is also good, it charges 2900mah battery within One and half an hour.SIM & SD Card Slot - It has 2 micro SIM slot and a dedicated SD Card slot (Upto 128GB)GPS - GPS compass is also accurate.CONS:-Portrait Games - This is an important cons, when I play portrait games (Ex: Clash Royale) the display seems to be cut on the width (this is due to 5.7" display). Not the problem for landscape games.Gaming Experience - I played Modern Combat 5 some part of games are bit laggy :(. Other games that I have listed in pros works cool.Battery - For Normal and Medium users battery will last for 1day. But for heavy users like me(crazy on gaming) it stands only for 6 - 8 hours so I listed in cons.Eventhough it has cons I gave 5star, because it is fair at this priceOTHERS:-Sound Quality - Sound quality is good and impressed with headphones (I don't like volume UI)Processor - It has 1.4GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 with Adreno 303 GPU (Not the powerfull but good performance with Nougat and fair at this price)Memory - 3GB RAM and 32GB ROM (Almost or Atmost 22GB Available) which is also good.Overall Micromax Canvas Infinity is best for medium users and selfie psycho'sFinal Word for Micromax - "Keep Going! You're on right track" :)	5
people it is not a phone problem its your data problem which you put inside and hangs ur phone...i am using this phone for a week now and it doesnt show any sign of problems which u have raised....and fingrprint is working 10  out of 10...sometimes they dont work due to peeling of our skin its problm with evry phone	5
I got this product before date ... Its not like infinity screen which is shown to us not like samsung S8 but at this price range it goodNot good for game loversCamera is not like much impressive both camera are just okBattery life is good but it has normal charger so mobile takes more time to chargePerformance is good not so farI give 3 stars cause camera is not on the mark	3
Good product at good price and the big thing it is a purely indian manufacturing and I proud to an Indian.great micromax.kwep it up what a camera and above all excellent product. Such a awesome product.	5
Whatapp functioning problem with this phone.... sometimes... automatically will not be able to receive or send messages ...after reboot it'll b fine ....but we can't do it always ...I hope with the next system update it'll b taken care of	3
Got it the next day of release ..does not support turbo charging but does charge upto 75% in an hour ..which is not bad at all.. Numerous features at hand ..like the immediate notification changes ..u can set then and there ..Finger print sensor can be used to open apps ..awesome camera when compared to higher end phones ..good speaker quality ..looks awesome ..all features have been provided flexibility ..Just love the phone ..And not to miss the flawless typing	5
Good phone in 10000 Rs. Initially felt like battery is small but after installing new update the battery performance improved drastically. I watch lots of YouTube videos and still able to use it for 1 and half days. Camera also very good especially front camera. Need to improve back camera and UI a bit but that's not a deal breaker at this price range. Micromax is doing fantastic stuff. Success will not come overnight please have a patience and keep doing good stuff. Service yet to experience. This phone is not for VR users and  gamers.	5
camera quality is very poor and its display see like a blur display ...But it's price very unique 9999 so its a good product.purchased it for myself,really it's worth the money .phone looks very premium.Good quality, great battery backup which I was thinking will be bad but thank God it is great. Display is awesome , Great phone in small budget	4

Awesome product from Micromax. I am fully satisfied with it's stunning looks, product quality, performance. It can beat any Chinese smartphone products in the market currently. You can blindly go for this smartphone. Also urge who are seeing my review to give off Chinese products and promote Indian products.	5
	5
Camera quality poor both rear & front.Display & color reproduction good.Movie watching experience nice for movie lover but sound output low.Touch good responsive.Finger print scanner work well.Looking may be nice if device body are in metal finish and color gold.Battery backup good.Calling quality good.LTE connectivity fine.	4
Please ensure the product IMEI no (box- mobile- invoice )Cross check the same	3
Best phone in this budget no heating no hang and no lag	5
Good Job...MicromaxBest phone under 10K..Micromax this time you deserve 100 out of 100 marks	5
Amazon .....About phone : -Camera is goodBattery is okDisplay is okSound is normalHanging problem is there ...Touch id working 2 times out 10 attemps ...And the big problem is no customer support...n Micromax claim 24*7 service ....I reported complaint 7 days ago but there is no revert from company ...I'm very upset with company ....I'm giving one star bcoz of camera otherwise  zero my side to this product n company	1
It is one of the decent product which was launched by micromaxCamera quality is goodScreen revaluation also very nice.....But battery power is not that much.....	4
I am impressed with this phone after using it couple of weeks.Its best money can buy at this price range.Pros:Camera Shutter speed is fast even in HDR.Photos (both f/b) quality is good.After installing 30 - 40 apps (including fitness apps ) the phone dint slowed down.Battery life is good.Head phone Sound quality is good.Using without a screen protector for more than 20 days but not a single scratch on the screen till now.Love the single swipe search for contacts, apps etc..Cons:Back panel looks too plastic and its finger print magnet.. cant use it without a back cover.The inbox screen protector and back cover is of cheap quality.Accessing quick buttons to enable/disable wifi, Bluetooth etc is a pain.	4
I am sharing this review, after using for around 6 months . First look of this phone is very impressive , after using this for around 6 months , I am facing lot of issues. First thing that it became very slow , and hangs very often. Sometimes I don't see calling screen to receive call, but phone will ring . Mic of phone fas stopped working. I am shouting from my side, other side person is not able to hear. I am using earphone all the time. Service centre guys are literally stupid. My phone is under the garuntee period they are adding extra cost of every thing. It's my last mobile from Micromax. I would recommend don't go with this product atleast.	1
one of the best selfie camera in this price range. ui like iphone. feel good to have this phone.	5
Awesome cameras quality and best display 18:9 HD displayoverall this is a too best phone in this price range.mostly all main feature available in this phone	5

Phone is good for the price range. Charging of the phone is slow.  The quality of camera's are not in consonance with the MP. Overall all a satisfying buy for the price range and over and above an Indian company , Cheers for that.	3
1.IT VERY GOOD PHONE FOR EVERY PERSON *****2.CAMERA PERFORMANCE  IS OUTSTANDING*****3.GAMING IS VERY GOOD****4.BEST FEATURE IN THIS PHONE I OTHER REVIEWS GIVE AFTER USE PROPERLY	5
Looks wise fantastic product.slim n good looking. Only drawback i feel compared to samsung is screen quality n density. 1080 p screen wud be awesome on this phone. n rear camera is ok ok. So if u can ignore screen n rear camera den this is best budget device. Selfie is good n recording as well.	4
Some of person says that this that...  ??????In my review if you want to compare 10k range phone.then is is super phone.I suggest to micromax plz increase batteries and some little work required back camera (because till i am using unite-2 till time & basic phone-x1850).	5
Body is goodScreen is good but briteness is not goodCharge is slowHd games has some lags on screenFront camara is goodRear camera is not good flash is not goodFinger print is goodIn 10000 is good but still not well micromax	4
Best android phone offered by Micromax in 10k .Everything is working as expected.both the cameras are awesome specially front.Device does not lag.Good UI.	5
I love the phone. The built quality the display the sound everything is amazing except that i am facing an issue where memory card is not getting detected. Visit from technical expert is suggested hope Amazon solves this issue by replacing the device.. Once done i would rate 5 for it..	2
I received this phone with earphone, screen guard and back cover.Screen guard is smaller the screen.Phone is awasome as per my experience.Good front camera, lightweight ,good battery and performance. you will definitely love this phone design.Thanks to Micromax this Great product.	5
Nice full value of  money...everything which you want, it is in it. Nice camera nice built quality, battery backup is good infinity display is good.I mean no worries GO FOR IT...	4
this is indeed a good phone it has a good performancePROS:-* superb camera back and forth with dual flash* LED notification indicator* massive 5'7 inches display with curved glass* Efficient fingerprint sensor* Features looks more like that of an iphone* 18:9 aspect ratio(feels like holding a galaxy S8)* Transparent mobile case in the pack* No issues with gaming* Looks beautiful* Its worth 10000CONES:-* Not fast charging* No gorilla glass, tempered glass must be separately purchased* The screen guard that I got in the pack was not sticky	4
A must buy phone considering its price. In love with the  Camera and features provided in that. Stylish looks, good battery backup comparison to its screen size. I'll not forget to mention speaker output also, it's very loud and clear. Cellular call quality is impressive and also work very fine with Jio SIM card.Keep my words, you buy it if your budget is 10k. Don't think about any other phone.	5
Don't buy this phoneAlways get hang. This is the reason the battery is removable	1
Good effort by micromax.But need improvement.processor should be more powerful. like a QC 650,435 OR MTK HELIO.Display should be more brighter.After usage of six months some software issues are found.1.my device is Encrypted. But not Asking for password after restart.2.when I press volume buttons. Icon appears in middle of screen.and freezing.still I touch another area of screen.3.OS is Lagging. Especially disturbs Gaming.4.Some time this phone forget that it have fingerprint scanner also.compulsory u have to use pin.I think update will solve it.I loss my Changing socket in just 6 months of use.Built Qualities should be improved.Nice Camera Both F/R. Portrait mode is excellent.	5
The phone is defective. Tried to convince Amazon to replace. But so far they are not in a mood to oblige	2
Micromax canvas infinity...After using for 3 months really disappointed with device, it's gone hang up when mobile data started sim contacts always loading, battery backup is not good as mentioned.Call receiving problem...	2
1. Awsm phone @ most affordable price.2. All spec r gr8.3. Decent cameras wd both front & rear flash.4. Fingerprint scanner superb.5. Got no heating issues yet...battery lyf gd.6. Upgradable 2 Android Oreo.	5
Worst phn I ever bought.	1
Very bad product charging time up to 8 hour slow and bad performance	1
Initially phone was working fine. But with in week started creating heating issues and also calling feature is not smooth, when we try calling or receive a call screen gets locked and black.  we are not able to disconnect or pick up call. Not able to perform any action once a call is dialled. Seems my money got wasted.	2
Looks good, feels good , works good. 18:9 display, front 16 mp with flash, compact 5.7 inch - all dese features are great to have in this price segment.Day to day usage is great , battry drops tp 30% with al day long usage and internet working throughout fr 24 hrs.To all people complaining about its performance - this is not lagging in that field, well i havent tried any games on it except asphalt 8 , still no lags felt yet, fingrprint works great.Yes , many will say redmi will perform better in this segment, bt for me this one has its own advantages,18:9,front flash,compact yet 5.7 display,NO HYBRID SLOT, 83% screen to body ratio - these dont come in them, even withing 10k.No heating issues as compared to my old beast yureka plus.	5
Build quality is goodLooks premiumCamera is awesomeDisplay is perfectBattery is good9/10	5
Although I bought it from market at same price of Amazon but I am happy to write review here. Well friends, to be very Frank, spending more than 10,000 on a mobile is sheer wastage of money. Many nice phones are available in 10,000 range. Initially I opted for Nokia 5 but when I came across Micromax I found it worth in this price range with numerous features. So far no issue in this phone. This phone has everything new which high end phones provide in 50,000 range. Everything is fine except screen quality bcz screen is slightly dull and yellowish. But at this price it is acceptable. Otherwise every other feature is fine and working normally. Micromax has finally provided quality in this handset. I don't know whether it is an Indian product or Chinese but phone is awesome. It is a combination of both Samsung bezzel less and iPhone x in look wise and app icon design wise. So in end I say, Don,t waste money on expensive phones bcz money saved is money earned. Be Indian, Buy Indian.	5
Impressive phonegood phoneAverage batteryGood selfy cameraGood Looking phonDisplay Aawsomebut I'm Not Satisfied Amazon product delivery Service my order Date 20/09/2017 & Delivery Date 03/10/2017 Strongly very bad Service AmazonGood&fast Service only flipkart	5

Very good productOnly sound system having low sound	5
Good lookAndroid 7.0Front camera 3/5Back camera 3/5Not full HD screenMicromax dual note is better than this in all aspectI give five rating because....if I would have given less rating..my review was not at top...	5
Awesome phone best phone by micromax.. I like it	5
After one month Micromax Infinity phone getting stuck after every minute. We are restarting unit problem not solved.Thinking of exchanging this phone at earliest.Pl revert	1
It's an awesome phone .....* Nyc camera clarity of Front and back both...* Snapdragon processor works completely fine* Screen quality is really awsm* Vr split mode is Missing* Audio quality is decent* Looks are really killer* Fingerprint scanner world completely well* Android 7.1 ...... works completely fine is stabilised* Worth Money product....	5
This is very bad phon .. it was very hang	1
Excellent product at this price. I always love micromax. I have used canvas magnus A117, canvas 4 a210 & now will use this. All earlier models are still in perfect condition but I purchased this for 4G. Will recommend all my friends.	5
Thanks to micromax...one of the best mobile with attractive look with superb camera performance both front and rear....at affordable prices..smooth performance....nice battery backup.....	5
A good phone has been devastated by very bad rear camera ......If you are making good package phone  than make every thing good....No meaning of 18:9 aspect ratio	3
Awesome mobileSuper quality goodMicro max good job next level	5
Perfect One and also with surprising features...Camera  quality is also well this pic captured by my Micromax Infinity...	4
phone is awesome but calculator Redmi4 many difference feature camera quality awesome touch is also good spanshot new system 3fingure down is good	5
Frequently handset getting heated. This is irritating a lot of inconvenience.Called macromax head office to report, but they all saying to stop the running background applications and giving xyz advises.Instead of advises now, they should do all R&D before product lunch and stop paying with customers.	1
this device is not worthy to buy . there is hanging problem, whatsapp often stop automatically, battery also doesn't work properly. There is no app and themes in personlisation, performance optimisation doesn't work. In short device is totally waste material. if you want to waste your money than go for this.	1
Highly disappointed. Front camera 16mp but it is poor than 13mp camera. Screen size 5.7 but it look like less than 5.5. Mobile specifications are good. I suggest to buy other mobile instead of this are else you too get disappoint.	1
Hats off to u Micromax ....grt job.. I m using this phone since 2 days but..I found nothing bad..all things working well..luv this phone	5
I excepted micromax canvas infinity today, isme screen problem aa rahi hai calling nahi ho raha kisi ka call aata hai tau screen me dikhta nahi hai aur calling-ending-loudspeaker etc. Ka option nahi dikhta, I'm so sad , I will go to micromax service center tomorrow	1
Mobile just ok.Display is ok.Heat is normal.But phone little bit lag. Due to entry level processor	3
Camera quality of front & rear is very poor. Phone hanging and heating too much. Battery back is also poor. Taking longer time to recharge the battery . Waste of money	1
Din't work with both Old & New 4G AIRTEL SIMssome SIM socket issue.So, got it replaced with new one.The new replaced oneworks ONLY with Old 4G AIRTEL SIMs (so, I have to be careful with my Airtel SIM to store it for as long as I used this phone)does Not work with New 4G AIRTEL SIMs	1
Display quality very poor...don't buy this product..it's a total money wastage..non refundable..non exchangeable...once you buy this horrible product you are stuck with it..it's not an Indian product...it's made in China..so don't buy this poor quality products phone just because it's made in india	1
It is bogus phone bought from China and Micromax cheating indians. The manufacturer of phone is jhnagjhung......something. The camera of phone is totaly disappointing and resolution is worst. The have inbuilt and feel like toy mobile having only 2, 3 ringtones only. The them is empty and nothing to goodness about	1
Nice phone, but i was think that its screen looking different but its look like normal mobile screen.Camera quality is nice, cheeper price, big storage, big screen,  batarry support 2 days without using net or WiFi, with net.. its support 1 day without any doubt.	4
Please don't ever go for this phone... Front and back camera are good... Look, feel and full vision display of the phone is good.. Apart from the above features you will regret buying this phone... I am using the phone for 3 months now and there is regular connectivity issue.. signal goes blank for some time and then back after some time.... I reboot the phone at least 3-4 times a day as the phone hangs up... Battery is pathetic and only stays for half day with normal internet use... Pls don't buy the phone or will regret	1
Worst phone  I ever had !!! Rear cover almost impossible to open I tried but atlast lost my nail!! Camera quality worst battery back average !! There are far much better option than this phone within this range !!! Also my power switch got damaged while trying to open back cover	1
Excellent packing & Delivery, Nice product good performanceonly negative side observed is Battery consumption too quick	5
Not bad ..its ok ....fine....but no good options ..camera quality is not as 13mp and 16 mp ....sound quality is good ..not 32gb its 22 gb....temp glass and back covr is not available in market.....bettr not buy.....no battry backup...waste dnt buy.	4
Phone lock button is defective. Hang several time. App do not close after closing all pop ups, it's remain in the minimized status. Battery back up is pathetic. Can't delete apps is a big time trouble in this hand set. And many more issues with this model. Just wasted my money.	1
First i recived phone in which speaker was not working properly,  so amazon replaced with new one.After using 15 day second phone now display is not working.after switching ON Screen goes blank off, nothing appears in screen...I need replacement or return it back...	1
Very good cell phone in this price range....happy for buying it... Full paisa vasual,......... Njoy :)	5
Very Good handset. Average call quality. Good built. Battery is OK. Camera is super.	4
Over all performance is fair,but system apps such as calender n clock are not upto  the mark.cant set schedule in calender n there no link for settings in alarm.cant u fix it?what we should do to find a remedy?	3
Everything is good battery is also good,I noticed that in notifications when drag from top to bottom in that when I go from to notifications to icons I means sidewards it is lagging and some lag is there though it is very good phone	4
Sometimes it's doesn't have proper response..	4
Good Features,Front Camera Quality is Good But No Regular Updates... Mobile While Charging Time, Missed Call & Message Alert indicator Not Alert.	4
Simply awesome experience. The new aspect ratio simply makes sense when it comes to one hand usage even with a big screen.	5
Screen garud given with the phone is smaller than the screen	4
If you are a fan of infinity display and have very tight budget then go for it.As you unbox the product you fall in love with the display that micromax has provided in this price range.And great packing by micromax.	5
Superb phone with best selfie camera,best pic in night also	5
Horrible performance. Worthless. No display during calls, and it resumes after ages, most of the time the phone requires to restart.	1
Both  camera  poor  quality  and  battery not  ok  and  not  3g ram and  normal  quality  mobile...	1
Display touch not work properly.This products don't more Run & Selling in market because Indian company Micromax has don't provide Quality. No.1 poor display touch.This is most important.	1
Excellent product from micromax.but better with 5000 battery. Recommend	4
beware for spywares.. preinstalled with spywares.. u ll feel like u bought it to c their ads.each day i hav to uninstall numerous apps/spywares which gets installed automatically.trust me i didn install any other apps other than the spywares and virus preinstalled by micromax. ur phone n datas r not safe with micromax.micromax canvas6	2
This is the best phone I ever used under 15000	5
Don't buy.  not worth for money !  Waste of money ! We think that this is an Indian brand so we need to encourage it !But when it doesn't work properly what us the use of buying ?	1
One of the wrost mobile. I have used a lot of mobile but this one is of the wrost among all of those. Chinese set, inferior mobile. There is a lot of problems in this mobile such as heating problem, auto rotate problem, sound problem, many more problems in this mobile	1
Battery should be more than 3500 MHZ	5
NOTE :@ In this Review I am Explaining its Battery Performance in Detail with all possible data.@ The package includes the Screen Guard & Cover.@ Earphones included are of decent quality.@ There's Dedicated Sim slot in this Phone, so you can use both the sim cards & sd card together.@ I am uploading few Images taken from Rear Camera.I am NOT explaining the overwhelming features of this phone in Detail, which most of the other Reviewers have already explained.Just summing up Key observations, then will explain the Battery stats,Pros:1) Processor coupled with RAM is above average and handles Moderate Level multitasking easily.* Out of 3 GB RAM less than 1.7 GB is free most of the time.2) Good Call Quality and there's NO problem in signal reception.3) Display is also Awesome and similar to LG Q6.4) Internal memory is Average i.e. 32 GB, with 128 GB extendable.* Out of which only 22.31 GB is available.5) Camera Quality is Impressive compared to the price tag.6) Battery Life is above average (check the details below cons for Stats.)7) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Fast.8) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, compass, etc.9) Has Android Nougat out of the box.Cons:1) NO Fast Charging and charging time is very long.2) NO Image Stabilization, which gives shaky video output.3) Back is bit Slippery.4) Heats alot after 40 mins of usage.5) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High.BATTERY PERFORMANCE STATS :----------------------------------------------------# Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 15mins. with stock charger.Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.)================================================@ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 8-10 Hrs.@ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 18-20 Hrs.@ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs.@ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 6-7 Hrs.@ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 5-5.5 Hrs.@ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 5-6 Hrs.@ Video Playback ---> 9-10 Hrs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERDICT:If you are fond of Larger screen to body ratio, then certainly go for it. This is good budget phone and very apt alternative to Redmi 4.But if you are avid gamer and Heavy Multi-tasker, then better invest bit more and purchase some good phone like Moto g5s plus, Redmi Note 4, etcThank You for reading this Review.	3
look very nice,good display,good battery no hitting problem,selfie cemra is very good,good job micromax,best phone under 10000,five star.	5

If only one could give negative rating, this is the product that deserves it. Hangs a lot. PM Modi app comes up every time you restart the cell, along with couple of other apps even if you uninstall them, they'll come up later. Touch becomes unresponsive sometimes.	1

This phone is not worth thr price. Just putting latest android software does not make this phone good. Phone to me looks and feels bit filmsy. I bgt it as my mom had never used a smart phone. Display can easily chip of i feel coz i ahd to open the back panel to palce the battery i could sense the screen can break . Also the screen gaurd and back cover cant protect the phone i feel. The scree looks cheap glass. This phone does not seem to be even little durable. Not worth the price . In my opnion this phone should not sell for more than rs 5000 dont go for the screen	1

Excellent product from Micromax	5
I bought it at 1st flash sale on 1st Sept 17. I found this phone very handy and a good value for money.Previously,I was not a FAN of Micromax. But now with this phone, i am.  Micromax renters with a good phone in present competition. I am sharing 10 Pros and only 2 Cons of this phone with 9 days of usage.Pros.1. Big 5.7 inch display with aspect ratio of 18:9. gives rich look to the phone.2. Both front and back cameras are awesome especially front camera is too good.3. it gives 1 day battery backup with normal usage which is good with 2900 mAh Battery and at this price level.4. Customized UI gives feel like iPhone.5. Sound Quality is very clear.6. No heating issue at all.7. One handed handling is possible.8. Micromax promised to provide Android "O" update waiting for it.9. Dedicated SD card slot.That means i can run 2 SIMs and 1 SD Card simultaneously.10. Build quality gives it a "Royal" LookCons-:1. Heavy Gaming not possible2. Sunlight Visibility is poor.	5

I have completed 4 days with Infinity.Look wise and camera quality is good.But Hanging and touch problem arise after sometime.	1
this is the best cell phone in Rs.10000/- budget	5
This product is one of it's kind in this price range. Best phone to buy for 10,000.I'l try to cover all the aspects in the review.1) Looks- Very attractive and good looking phone.2: Screen- Beautifull screen. Curved glass. 5.7 inch screen.3) Processor- Snapdragon 425, does the job pretty well. The phone is smooth, and does not lag at all while multi tasking as well.4) 3 GB ram and 32 GB Internal memory, which is good.5) battery- 2900 Mah battery- Does the job pretty well. Easily last for a day.6)Camera - both the cameras are good, especially the front camera. both sides have flash.7)Less heavy phone comparitively8) Android naughat works well.9) Dedicated slot for sd card is an advantage, back cover can be opened.10)Got good finger print scanner11) Additional Accessories- phone back cover, head phone, screen guard.10) No Cons, to be serious. Worthy for 10,000.GO FOR IT.	5

Very worst product	1
I've fallen in love!Micromax Canvas Infinity.1. its design is augmented .2. its processor is highly speedy.3. display is truly HD.4. memory capacity is much enough .5. at a time we are used  two sim and one memory card6. This is Indian base product ( we are Indian).7. Front Camera its very good.8. Price is Very Goodddddd.8. and finally its a rocking.......	5
It's now 3 days I am using this phone and posting my review based on my experience for that time.The phone is nice to use and I am really satisfied for the price I paid. Amazon packing was not satisfactory but I received the phone way too fast in 2 days.I liked the phone from the very first look. Although the picture of phone on the box and website shows much less bezel as compared to actual device the phone is nice to hold despite having such a big display.Software wise I did not like the preinstalled UI at all and installed Nova launcher the 2nd day itself. Rest I can say the phone does not lag much but you can notice small delay in response if you have used better phones (obviously higher configuration and high price).On the hardware front I really liked the front camera with a selfie flash (not mentioned) the rear camera was just satisfactory. The battery is giving enough juice for more than a full day with moderate use and so I don't miss fast charging much. No heating issue at all is the prime attraction despite having a metal back. The finger print recognition is fair enough as sometimes it does not recognize the finger properly. The back feels premium although I use the back cover provided in the box (it's quite decent). The screen guard is just a waste. Head phone quality is just average. The speaker output is loud and pretty clear. 3 separate slots for 2 sim and SD card is good added benefit.So overall I would surely recommend this phone a musy buy for those who are looking a good phone in low budget.	4

But nice phone in this price total paisa vasool.	3

Not good..1. sms app not working, i couldn't receive or send sms through the phone..2. Amazon customer Care executive couldn't help me.. they are not ready to replace the phone.3. Camera is worst quality..Also it's preloaded Narendra Modi app, that you could not uninstall or disable it.I strongly recommend that not to buy.	2
Great awesomeIt's compared no one... Great sound effects, superb camera, 2days battery backups, nice finger print sensor, 4g net backup one day ... Thank u to micromax great Indian phone... Jaihind....	5
this phone is awesome	5
after two days of using i am writing this reviwMajaor problem is that phone takes 07 Hour for full charging ( Very Slow Charging)  and also heated lots  at the time of using. Games does not run on phone, its stuck on 97% then its not move forward and then phone hanged . I also did software update but there was a no improvement. Camera quality is average in light but poor in night. I got a replacement order on dt 03 but again same problem of battery charge, phone takes 6 hrs and 15 min.for full battery charge, its too much hectic @ amazon look in to matter.	1
This is a very bad product. My buying mobile is not  on and i am very suffering for returning prossess. Very bad experience in buying this product. I think i have not buying in any product in online. And micromax service station experience is also very bad. So i really hurting im this time. Amazon your not provided service in like your tag line and i expected	1
Worst product ever.I purchased this phone some days before. At the time of unboxing the phone it looks so attractive but when started using i got irritated by product.Company is literally cheating customers by attractive advertisements.The issues I'm suffering in this phone are:It gets hang alot alot alot... Fingerprint sensor not working properly.. Takes too much time in charging and it's really irritating in comparison with other normal phonesI'm a Musician and i had a live show a day before and my friend took a video recording of my performance in this phone but the phone speaker is torning the sound.. It's not even sounding proper..Phone mic quality is very much bad and cheaper that it can't withstand with the speakers volume frequency and starts torning sound..Not even single video of my performance is sounding clear.. And it irritated me the most..Don't do mistake of buying..Company reputation is zero after using this handset..Only looks attractive nothing else is good in phone..	1
It is a good mobile. All the facilities of a descent android at a reasonable price.I feel battery backup could have been better.Otherwise nice....	5
Actually I buy this cell from amazon and using it from week as  I observed the second slot of Sim is not working from the second day after buying. The back panel is not good as it must be . All other features are good e.g camera. display. But one thing disappointing about the colour of cell  that it comes in only black colour	3
Phone has major lagging which is not supposed to be in this range of phones.List of issues the software has :-1. Music player shows list of music files which external sd card contain although the card been unmounted.2. If you start internet and there are more number of message to load cell gets hang for some time this is a major disadvantage which i have found in this phone.3. When you delete files with larger number of records the phone gets stuck and delete operation also gets stuck. You have to restart phone to recover from lagging.4. Need some optimization so it does not lag	2
Excellent Handset for this price.But one thing is that Micromax must provide its tempered glass as early as possible.Because we are not getting its accurate glass.	5
Very bad fon plz don't go for it it's screen not 5.7 it's only looking like 4 .5	1
Camera result is very bad.16 mp camera ! They make us foolish.Returning policey is also bad.I tried from last week to replace it.It's china made mob	1
Sluggish Phone, Poor speed, can feel like phone with 3 GB of RAM, apps and camera open at very slow speed,Poor fingerprint scanner, DONT PURCHASE THIS PHONE ....	1
Do not buy ...its touch is not supporting .....properly...only after 20 days of delivery....	1
Amazon indiaMohit Chetnani+91 7878259193I am trying to contact Amazon but now the Amazon customer support is worst.Ordered from +917990366161As soon I ordered the the phone I faced a battery problem on day 2 even I was using the original charger. Then it worked good for next 4 days. Again the problem of battery started. And the camera is the main problem from day 1.Now comes the main  it is the worst thing i can expect from Amazon india.The main thing I can't believe is that the Amazon can do like this as we treat Amazon as our family member..... If you want to support your customer contact  me on +917878259193...+ i facing some times i use phone 20 to 30 mins continuesly than my phone is too much hot. I think amazon cheats me. I think amazon is big brand but no this is wrong....... I want to give this phone to 0 star but there has no option.. I am not satisfied 	1

I purchased Micromax Canvas Infinity on 3rd Sep 2017.Phone gets stuck in the middle of calling or just browsing internet and won't even restart. I need to remove and put back battery to resume phone. It's horrible and (Unfortunately) now there is no replacement.I'm hoping Micromax service centers fix this problem.	1

Worst mobile I had purchase in my life is micromax canvas infinity...mobile gets totaly hang...now I am not able to see screen when call is ringing or incoming call......only within 4 months I m getting these problems....so dont buy this phone..worst phone	1
Not up to the markLess battery lifeAnd old processorBetter go with MI which have same price but performance and battery life is better than this.	2
Definitely Not an infinity display. Don't get fooled by Micromax. Looks good though.	3
I am very much satisfied with the phone in this price range. Can't expect the performance of a higher price range model to be honest. But it's true that Micromax need to work on the battery, otherwise it's a nice phone in this price range.	3
It is good phone phone looking is excellent and the experience is always good because I use before Micromax canvas nitro 2 is very Good phone and it's looking is outstanding so I like Micromax company I like it and love it Thanks	5
Nice product at this price range. Good Value for money. Display and Camera are very good. Battery lasts about 12 hrs.	5

Specifications of the phone is good. But phone is not durable. Jab tak chal jaye chala lo. Kabhi bhi kharab ho sakta hai.	3
camera quality is very poor and its display see like a blur display ...But it's price very unique 9999 so its a good product.	3
This phone is very slow as I'm annoyed using it and battery backup is very poor with it's all very charging don't go for it	1
After use of one week there is network problem need to restart phone within a hour to get network back ..very disappointed	1
Best phone under 10k..... believe me...sd 425 processor and full vision display! 16 mp front camera 12 mp rear camera!! Far better than Opportunity and VIVo	5
It's made in China...which I don't like to keep Chinese mobile.Also it's start hanging even phone memory is empty.Overall I suggest don't buy online it's better to chk at local market.	1
Very Nice product, loved it very much. Superb phone in this price!!well done Micromax, Keep it up!!	5
Good phone, Screen Quality is good. Thanks Amazon for making delivery too fast.Good battery backup, camera and UI is nice.But I got defective earphone, it's increasing and decreasing volume itself continuously, pretty much irritating.	4
AWESOME PHONE... MICROMAX ROCKS...	5
Very bad battery and front camera	1
Nice product easy to use....nice gestures and display	5
Highlights.The Micromax Canvas Infinity has been launched at Rs. 9,999The 18:9 screen is the biggest highlight of this device .For appreciating our efforts you can buy this product from this link also. - http://amzn.to/2EoVbZFA lot of smartphone companies are now designing phones with screens that occupy their entire front surfaces, and nearly no borders. This year's most premium smartphones, including the LG G6, Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Note 8, have all featured these taller screens. Different brands have their own buzzwords, such as LG calling its screens FullVision while Samsung uses the term Infinity Display, but they all promise more screen and less body. Thankfully, these screens are already being featured on phones at more affordable prices, such as the LG Q6 and the recently unveiled Micromax Canvas Infinity.LG's Q6 has been priced competitively to take on other phones at the Rs. 15,000 level. Micromax, on the other hand, has different aspirations, and has positioned its all-new Canvas Infinity in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment. The company has already confirmed that there will be more models in the Canvas Infinity series.The 18:9 screen is this phone's biggest talking point but is that enough to challenge the competition? At this price level, the Canvas Infinity will have to take on some popular models including the Xiaomi Redmi 4, Nokia 5, Moto G5, and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, all of which offer better hardware. We find out in our review.Micromax Canvas Infinity designIn terms of design, the 18:9 screen is the first thing you'll notice about the Canvas Infinity, and we did feel that this made the phone seem premium. It has rounded corners matching the exterior of the phone. However, we're confused by the official images shared by Micromax at launch time, which show a nearly bezel-less design. In reality, the phone has much thicker borders than seen in its promotional shots, and you'll notice the difference immediately. While the sides are narrow, the top and bottom are quite thick, much more than what we've seen on the premium Galaxy S8 (Review) and LG G6 (Review). Micromax claims that the 83 percent screen-to-body ratio is equivalent to that of the Galaxy S8 series.Rather than having a metal unibody, the back of this phone pops off. It has a removable battery, and dedicated slots for dual Micro-SIMs and a microSD card which is much preferable to having a hybrid dual-SIM slots like most other phones in this category. Micromax has used top-notch plastic on the Canvas Infinity, because it really doesn't feel cheap, and a lot of people around us thought it was metal at first glance. We had no problem using the phone with just one hand, and it fits well within a palm thanks to its size and rounded corners. The narrower screen and relatively thin borders make this feel like a 5.5-inch phone when it actually has a 5.7-inch screen.Like several other phones, there are lines running across the top and bottom of the rear. The power and volume buttons are on the right and are easily accessible with a thumb or forefinger. The Micro-USB port is on the bottom while the 3.5mm audio jack is on top. Much like other phones with 18:9 screens, the Canvas Infinity also uses on-screen navigation keys. The fingerprint scanner is on the back, right below the camera, and there's a Micromax logo towards the bottom. It was easy to reach even when using the phone with one hand.Despite its size and shape, this screen is also a let-down. It has a resolution of 720x1440 pixels and is an IPS panel, but its quality isn't up to the mark. In our opinion, the display on the Canvas Infinity is the least accurate in terms of colours that we have seen in the budget segment for a long time. During the review period, we noticed yellow and bluish tinges when looking at it from the sides, which was annoying. Sunlight legibility was weak as well despite the brightness being pushed up to its maximum. Considering that Micromax plans to launch more phones in the Canvas Infinity series, we hope that the company uses better quality displays. Overall, the Micromax Canvas Infinity keeps its promise of delivering an 18:9 aspect ratio screen in the budget segment, but there are severe tradeoffsInside the box, the company bundles the standard documentation, a transparent back cover, earphones, a charger, a Micro-USB cable, and the phone itself. The Canvas Infinity will be an Amazon India exclusive at launch time but will be made available offline later. Micromax sates that consumers can expect a straight replacement if it is unable to repair any problem with the phone.Micromax Canvas Infinity specifications and softwareThe Micromax Canvas Infinity is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 SoC clocked at 1.4GHz, coupled with 3GB of RAM. This is the same processor that we've seen powering the entry-level Xiaomi Redmi 4A (Review). There's 32GB of storage which is expandable by up to 128GB using a microSD card. The phone also has a 2900mAh battery that is rated to offer talk time of 20 hours and standby time of 420 hours.At the phone's launch event, Micromax heavily promoted the Canvas Infinity's cameras. This phone sports a 16-megapixel front camera with a soft flash, f/2.0 aperture and face beauty modes. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor with an LED flash and f/2.0 aperture as well. Connectivity options include 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth, GPS, AGPS, and OTG support. There's an accelerometer and proximity, light and magnetic sensors as well.The Canvas Infinity runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat with the company's My Launcher on top. This is the most current iteration of Nougat in the budget smartphone market right now, and Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma has confirmed that the Canvas Infinity will be upgraded to Android 8.0 Oreo soon. Unfortunately, my Launcher manages to bury almost all important Nougat features. There are no app shortcuts, quick toggles, or revamped notifications. Only some features, such as split-screen multitasking, direct replies and quick app switching are supported. The phone uses an icon pack that mimics iOS, and the Settings app is clearly inspired by it too. We prefer the custom UI of Micromax's own Yu Yureka Black, which we reviewed few months ago.There is a plethora of bloatware including Apps Centre, Personalise, Videos, and Music, which cannot be deleted. Some of the third-party ones that can be uninstalled are the Narendra Modi, Amazon Shopping and Facebook. The Canvas Infinity is therefore a let-down in terms of software. Our recommendation would be to switch to the Pixel Launcher or use a third-party option like Nova Launcher or Yahoo Aviate.The phone supports Smart Actions which let you do things like wake up or lock the phone by double tapping the screen, flipping it to mute calls and alarms, and automatically accepting calls when you lift the phone to your ear. There are also Smart Gestures which can help launch apps quickly. You use this feature by drawing an alphabet like "O" which launches the camera. We used the Smart Gesture feature and it worked flawlessly. Micromax has also added a one-handed mode which gets enabled when sliding left or right across the navigation bar.Micromax Canvas Infinity camerasThe Micromax Canvas Infinity sports a 16-megapixel front-facing camera, which is being heavily promoted by the company. It has a soft flash, f/2.0 aperture, 5P lens, and comes with face beauty mode. The company is touting the camera's portrait mode which blurs the background similar to the bokeh effect that you can get on phones with dual cameras. Unfortunately, shots taken in portrait mode looked like they were had been Photoshopped with a heavy blur effect, and subjects seemed to have been auto-enhanced with unnatural colours. However, regular selfies were passable and showed good colours with decent amounts of detail in good light. In low-light, selfies were too dark without the soft flash.There's also a 13-megapixel rear camera with an LED flash and f/2.0 aperture. It, too, supports portrait mode though it required some amount of adjustment to get the software to apply its enhancements. Shots taken with the Canvas Infinity came out with pleasant and natural colours under good light. We got some good macro shots, and landscapes were decent. However, we found that high-contrast scenes were often underexposed, which meant a loss of detail in the shadows.When zooming in to 100 percent, the Micromax Canvas Infinity photo samples showed noise but were still passable for social media posts. Autofocus works accurately in good light though you will have to do it manually in low-light situations.Unfortunately, the low-light performance of both cameras is below par. Both the front and rear cameras need some amount of direct light around to illuminate images or they end up looking too dark with heavy noise across the entire image and minimal details.We liked the camera app on the Canvas Infinity, which had most options just one tap away. With the camera roll feature, you can take a look at the last photo you took without the need to close the main app. There's a feature called Super Pixel which takes multiple shots at the same time and combines them to give you a higher resolution and more detail. We noticed that images taken with Super Pixel were better than regular shots, though they looked a little artificial.Micromax Canvas Infinity performanceWe have reviewed several phones with the Snapdragon 425 SoC, and they have all performed decently. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Micromax Canvas Infinity which was sluggish right from the start. We encountered slow responses to our touch inputs which is something we don't expect from phones at this price anymore. We also faced app crashes on the Canvas Infinity which affected usability. We blame the My Launcher UI in part for the phone's sluggish performance. It's worth noting that the phone responded better when using a third-party launchers.Thanks to the extended screen space, we found it easier to use GPS navigation and multitask with two apps simultaneously on the Canvas Infinity. No metal in the body meant that the phone didn't get too warm, which is a good thing. We used the phone extensively for watching videos and didn't feel it heating then either.We can't recommend the Canvas Infinity for gaming enthusiasts, however, as the phone stutters while playing heavy games such as Marvel: Contest of Champions and Asphalt 8: Airborne. Lighter titles like Angry Birds, Temple Run 2, and Subway Surfers were playable without any issues.The Micromax Canvas Infinity managed 36,753 in AnTuTu, 13fps in GFX Bench, 3,649 in 3D Mark Ice Storm Extreme, and 10,925 in Quadrant.Calls were clear and the bundled earphones were relatively good. Unfortunately, the speaker wasn't loud or clear enough, and its placement at the back meant that you might not hear it at all if the phone is left on a soft surface. We were able to make VoLTE (voice over LTE) calls using a Jio SIM on the Canvas Infinity. The phone, however, doesn't support direct 4G video calling, a feature being offered by Reliance Jio. Both SIMs can work on 4G networks, though only one at a time.Micromax Canvas Infinity battery lifeThe removable 2900mAh battery is claimed to deliver up to 420 hours of standby time and up to 20 hours of talk time. In reality, the phone did actually last for roughly 20 hours with heavy usage. During our review, we used the phone heavily for watching videos and streaming media, and the battery did well overall. In our standard HD video loop test, it lasted for 10 hours and 20 minutes, which is good enough for a battery of this size. There's no fast charging, and the Micromaxa Canvas Infinity took roughly two hours to charge fully.VerdictPriced at Rs. 9,999, the Micromax Canvas Infinity tries to bring an 18:9 display to the budget market. While we have to commend Micromax for trying, this phone definitely falls short in many areas. Despite the display being this phone's highlight, it is also its biggest disappointment. The My Launcher skin is buggy and performance is sluggish. If you're in the market for a sub-Rs. 10,000 Android smartphone, you should look at other options such as the Xiaomi Redmi 4 (Review), Moto G5 (Review), Nokia 5, or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review), all of which have better hardware at around the same price. If you still want a smartphone with 18:9 display just because it's something new, then you should save up some money and go for the LG Q6 (Review) instead.	4
Micromax has really done a comeback. Screen brightness is not low as said in reviews, user interface is very good like moto x play( 16000 inr phone) , camera quality is wonderful more than mi phones of this range under 15k , very slim in look , easy to handle . I have used moto x play and mi note 4 . Overall I rate it better than them . A good indian brand phone and feel of infinity display is awesome . Better than any chinese brand of same price tag . Best phone for medium use people who use internet and all . I have not tried gaming . But what do u expect from. 10k phone Xbox.. overall rating is wonderful ...	5

Great mobile in this price.. excellent camera..which no one vl offer under this price..using it for 7 months..no complain..smooth running.	5
Pathetic user interface . Lots of touch required to access any single details. I don't want modi app and also asphalt nitro.Everytime I un install and re boot the phone both apps are again installed automatically.Is it that now Micromax will decide what app to install and remove. I am feeling like a slave for Micromax .2 star only for looks	2
Amazing screen,perfect selfie.......Good Work	5
It's a good phone for the price but you will feel the lack of performance and bad Micromax software that has some problems otherwise the phone is good.	3
I lost my canvas infinity somebody help me to find my phone	3
i just hate it .now i think amazon is a very bad company it just sell us old items and defective ones.within 6 months my mobile is damaged.	1
Made in China product of Indian company never compet with make in India product of chinees company When will our company improve themselves	1
This is a awesom phone at this price....	5
Heating issues and battery drain out .	2
Best awesome and lovely product by micromax just loving it.Much more better and effective than MiPerson having buget of 10k should buy only this phone	5
Very Nice LookingAppreciatable Camera QualityBRILLIANT Finger SensorOne hand mode BestBatterylife good. Charging SlowOverAll Good Zabardast	5
I want to exchange my micromax infinity but it is not showing....	2
i have used this phone and after thoroughly using it am giving this review.according to me this is a beautifully crafted super slim, powerful and super strong phone. it is coupled wit 3 gb of ram along with 1.4 GHz cortex a53 quad core processor which makes this phone powerful on performance and  a great battery effecient. at first looking at its processor i thought that it would be a problem of slow processing and hangs but believe me its a miracle. despite of having a slower processor than other phones it really fast and is quite of a compitation to other phones at this price range. now coming to its display its really amazing to have a phone with bazleless display. its display is totally frol right to left. there is no unused spaces at d sides... it is totally covered by the display.now coming to its cameras... this phone has very good cameras. the rear camera is 13 MP with f2.0 apperature which takes great pictures even in low light as it is coupled with a very bright LED flash. coming to the front camera it has a 16 MP selfie camera of f2.0 apperature with 16 beautification modes and is also coupled with a bright selfie flash.now coming to the side features it has a 2800 mAh removable battery and micrimax has done a very good work in this phone nd that is to make this battery of international quality. so this battery is of very good quality. it has a dedicated slot for its 2 sim cards and a microsd card which is missing in most recent phones. it supports OTG and has a very good international ranking.ITS A VERY GOOD PHONE AND THIS PHONE WILL NOT FAIL ITS CUSTOMERS AND THE SERVICE OF MICROMAX HAS BEEN IMPROVED TO A GREAT EXTENT.	5
The infinity is the highlight feature of this phone.It offers 3gb of ram and 32gb of storage .It has a 5.7 inch Hd display which is quite impressive.2900Mah battery is a let down .425 Snapdragon has some heating issues.Overall a okay phonePlease like if you found it helpful	3
awesome phone for this priceing	5
Hanging issue	3
Just Like Samsung Micromax Launched It's Infinity Display Mobile Phone In This Competitive Market.These Are My Personal Inspection.Here Are Some Pros And Cons:Pros:18:9 Screen At A Low PriceCompact PhoneDedicated SIM And MicroSD Card SlotsCons:Display Quality Is Below ParCustom UI is BuggyPerformance Is Sluggish	3
A very nice phone after a long period. With infinity display and loud volume. A must have phone	5
It is good in performance no doubt, i have used several micromax mblsBut look is worst in ten thousand.. It is just like wearing no gold nd diamond rings but the dressing sense is like a beggar...In ten thiusand comp must give metallic body nd dynmic look	3

Nice phone in a budget range value for money product it could be snapdragon 625 instead of 425 but i bought for my mom for a basic use so thats ok!	4
Mobile software is very poor and again problem continue camera quality is running and no megapixel total review poor.	3
Phone is good but battery back up is not good... Battery back up is so short...	4

Pathetic phone.I switched it on and it hanged, had to remove the battery and switch it on again after putting the battery back.While typing a message the typed alphabet appears after almost 15-16 seconds.Sound is also not upto the mark.Amazon is not even ready to refund.	1
Best phone in this this price range.	5

It is excellent	5
Awesome deal...loved it	5
Awesome phone no lags till now....and overall it looks premium....highly recommended	5
here's an honest review .. two stars only coz of laggy UI and amazon's return policy .. phone over all is okay not that bad .. camera and screen and other stuff is fine.. whats not fine is its keep getting crashed and lags alot like hell.. as for the phone i would add more cash and buy a different and better phone with more ram and strong processor... i requested for my refund but amazon is only providing replacement ..means same device with same lagging issues and dumb UI .. i hope i get my money back  and get a new phone.	2
Super phone........I love it	5
It was completely worth buying a phone like this....For just 10K....	5

Terribly disappointed, had ordered the phone during the big sale got it in time but was defective. Basic function like calling was hampered, person on the other end couldn't hear your voice. Plus getting a return takes hell lot of time, refund expected but all I'm getting is a replacement for this phone.	1
Guys, this phone has network issues.. It is not able to detect sims, Many of my friends also faced the issue and we've returned the device. We've confirmed the same by inserting the same sim in different phones and they're working fine. Just think about this before buying	2
Photos not stored in both Phone & SD card.Mobile get hang.	1
I have bought this mobile one week ago and i think i have wasted my money because tge battery backup is not very good and poor camera quality. It is a good looking phone but its features Are below average.	1

NOTE :@ In this Review I am Explaining its Battery Performance in Detail with all possible data.@ The package includes the Screen Guard & Cover.@ Earphones included are of decent quality.@ There's Dedicated Sim slot in this Phone, so you can use both the sim cards & sd card together.@ I am uploading few Images taken from Rear Camera.I am NOT explaining the overwhelming features of this phone in Detail, which most of the other Reviewers have already explained.Just summing up Key observations, then will explain the Battery stats,Pros:1) Processor coupled with RAM is above average and handles Moderate Level multitasking easily.* Out of 3 GB RAM less than 1.7 GB is free most of the time.2) Good Call Quality and there's NO problem in signal reception.3) Display is also Awesome and similar to LG Q6.4) Internal memory is Average i.e. 32 GB, with 128 GB extendable.* Out of which only 22.31 GB is available.5) Camera Quality is Impressive compared to the price tag.6) Battery Life is above average (check the details below cons for Stats.)7) Finger Print sensor is Lightening Fast.8) Has Lots of sensor like accelerometer, gyro, compass, etc.9) Has Android Nougat out of the box.Cons:1) NO Fast Charging and charging time is very long.2) NO Image Stabilization, which gives shaky video output.3) Back is bit Slippery.4) Heats alot after 40 mins of usage.5) Ram Consumption by System apps. as usual is High.BATTERY PERFORMANCE STATS :----------------------------------------------------# Charging from 0 to 100% takes 2hrs 15mins. with stock charger.Usage Mode ---> Battery Performance(Avg.)================================================@ Mobile Data(3g/4g) Used Continously ---> 8-10 Hrs.@ Normal Calling Only + Standby ---> 18-20 Hrs.@ Normal Calling + Music Playback( Continuous ) ---> 10 Hrs.@ Internet Usage on WiFi Only( No Calling ) ---> 6-7 Hrs.@ Gaming ( Wifi) ---> 5-5.5 Hrs.@ Gaming ( without WiFi ) ---> 5-6 Hrs.@ Video Playback ---> 9-10 Hrs.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------VERDICT:If you are fond of Larger screen to body ratio, then certainly go for it. This is good budget phone and very apt alternative to Redmi 4.But if you are avid gamer and Heavy Multi-tasker, then better invest bit more and purchase some good phone like Moto g5s plus, Redmi Note 4, etcThank You for reading this Review	5

It was a pathetic experience of buying mobile from amazon.I would not suggest any  to buy any product from this site.First time I purchased this item (Micromax Canvas Infinity),It was hanging at the first day & Brightness was so less you can not see anything in sunlight & Camera of this phone (rear & front ) are pathetic,After their engineer verified all defects they returned the products ,When i received the new product battery was missing.I was so pissed off i asked for refund.I thought it's trusted company will initiate refund if anyone pissed of any product.But they refused to refund.So i suggest you guys never buy any product from this site.They are just looting like anything.	1
How to make calls in this mobile without jio 4g voice calling app	4
Hi Guysi love this phone i did not purchased from amazon but still i like it very much and i want to review it.I purchased it offline @ INR 9500/- the phone is working awesome and i am enjoying it games run smoothly no hanging problem camera quality is awesome i also have VIVO V5s and i compare both camera and i find both processing same kind of pictures.	5
Excellent product for the price. I'm extremely happy with its battery performance.	4
Its supercool device with full view and many more features.I will skip the features which are explained in many reviews. I am always looking for something innovative in smart phones. and here in Infinity I found some cool features to declare it as real smart one.Feature which are not mentioned in reviews are need to be highlighted. Smart gesture you can use to configure shortcuts to many app or actions.I have made 10 smart gesture for YouTube ,Gmail, gallery, calling to a number and bank app etc. Finger print sensor is also can be used for opening an app or call to number or send message to a number. And one more features to boost for is voice and face unlock. It work very well.	4

Very Good Experience with new mobile	5
Though cameras performance can not be doubted but you shoot video and playing back, audio/sound very poor.Though option to add language to your choice is there other than English/Hindi but despite of adding Punjabi for instance, keyboard does not appear.English/ Hindi ate default language only and other language does not support. It is a made in China product.Purchased couple of days back only, so can not comment much and unaware issues come in future. Service centre staff not attending politely.	2
Very good phone	5
Best product after 10 days of use.	5

I have received the phone by Amazon on 4  11 2017 nd I did not received back procetive cover in my box which I had complained to customer care but no response nd have also written a letter to supplier cloudtail India Bangalore but no response,  worst phone I have purchased in my life I will give ooooooooo point to Micromax infinity I had seen the adv of Micromax infinity launch by CEO of Micromax nd had purchased it ..............but I got very bad experience .......... It is totally opposite what ever told by Ruhul Sharma CEO of Micromax at the launch of infinity mobile, pls do not by this type of products by only seeing a adv. I had taken my I phone 6 nd also this micromax infinity mobile to Dubai tour from 6 to 12 Nov nd I shot all photo in this camera instead of I phone the photo taken in Dubai tour we're tottaly waist very very dissapointed not even 1 photo of 500 taken came nice at all I am thinking of taking a legal action agaisnt them....... They waisted my life memories of Dubai and waisted my time no reply from Amazon nor from Micromax I am thinking a legal complaint through cosumber court	1
Micromax infinity is excellent smartphone off the range comper to other brand mobile phone excellent battery backup Nice look Nice camera m advices other people purchrge this Nice smartphone	5
The Phone is Vary Badly Hack And Betrry Was Vary Bad.	1
Phone look very nice ....But Head phone quality is very bad...And head phone jak is not working well and sound is very low when connected to car system or any other sound system	3
You mean infinity like Samsung, I know it's worth it's price, but this absolutely is not a infinity display, nothing compared to s8 infinity. This phone is just a bulky, battery forever, not that great gaming, camera okay,  budget phone at 10K, so ya !!	3
In love wid slik design ...the first micromax phone i have buy in my life and found it amazing....such a good responsive touch...such a amazing display.....best budget smartphone under 10000...micromax show the chinese that we have the power to beat u...make in india	5
One of the best product in this price	5
Worst phone i have ever seen. Actual design of Mobile is Different from the image they shown on Amazon and mobile Box. Performance is also bad.	1
Superb mobile at 10000 price .Only need big battery life than perfect mobile.	4
When doing a call not be possible to disconnet, touch not work proper most of the time using multiple, game not play proper	1
Battery backup best hCamera selfie ke liye jyada behtar h aur rear cam ka hdr mode me acchi pic aati hOverall best phone hai is range me	5
Hi Guys,Totally waste of money Plz dont buy it.Its take 5 hours to charging & battery is lasting maximum 4 hours...	1
Really Good Phone in this Price. Camera and Display are awesome. But It is not good for powerful Game after all everything is good	5
Its a good product in this price range. The camera is a prime factor of this device. The display is HD, not full Hd still excellent even in bright daylight condition. The battery is fine for a day use with a good amount of gaming, videos and net surfing. However, Micromax should have given a better processor for a full 5 star review	4
I love the full vision display on the phone! And the front camera is killer for selfies. A good option to go for in this price range.	5
Wrost phone	1
Within a month problem has started in the phone. Screen becomes black when a call is made from the other side. also it takes a lot of time to open the screen after  pressing the keys. I had expected a better product from Micromax .	1
Amazing phone, superb battery backup, HD big screen, affordable price.overall best phone in the market in lowest price.	5
Good job	5
It's not perfect phone on display.	1
Amazing product. Keep the spirit up MICROMAX.	5
Very Good Phone in such a low price, All fetures of this mobile are amazing. Strongly recomonded to buy this Mobile.	5
Look like curved display, nice camera overallAgr mi note 4 kharid rhe ho to Bhai processing k alawaba kuch khas nhi milega jisne mera phn dekha gzb bataya h & support India yrr....	5
Worst quality & performance, during start of  mobile data at that time very slow performance and during using of memory card gives slow performance. Battery backup is worst and ear phones cheap quality. Again and again hanging. So see all ratings before buy this product.	1
Hanging problem working procecer very slow	1
Received a faulty product twice, phone does not get switched on without charger being attached.	1

I bought this mobile from Amazon.from 2nd day onwards the phone started hanging and sometimes network issue..not gud for those who is  internet freak..And as per Amazon policy they can exchange with same new peice.but I don't want to buy the same mobile after my experience.	1
Hello guys,I had rated 1 star in my earlier review. Actually I had got a defctive phone, I then returned it to Amazon, now I received a good device. Am using it since one week, till now it's not hanging or heating problem. Overall its a good phone. Worth buying.Thank you Amazon for returning a product.	4
Micromax shame on you.Why is Narendra Modi's apps is there in the mobile. How much money paid Modi to you to do so. Please dont do it in the future. I am planning to return it.Very shame to you.	1
I just 10 days ago bought this phone now this phone has started screen touch problems.Battery life is 5 to 8 hours if u listener , watching video's or chat on social media .So my review is don't waste money. Put 2 to 3k more and get another good phone.	1
Super phone from micromax, amazing looks, nice camera	5
Awesome display,  great perfromance and supreb picture quality... Well done micromax and amazon too..  India k sapno ki apni dukaan:-)	5

Pathetic sound quality in earphones u can't hear more than 5 min u will get headacheThey offered much in 10k but little more would have been better n they cl u to write it review	1
processor is tooo old and very slow.....picture quality is not good...pixels are not good as have to be	1
Damaged products heating mobile when playing game and direct call received when mobile in pocket	1
Worst sound quality. Cannot even hear out of the mic during a call. Refrained to using speaker in public which is an inconvenience. Micromax support is another nightmare. Made me wait 10-15 mins twice before cutting the call mid way. Keep away.	1
worst mobile battery is not working properly it became hot during usage customer caaaare service is not good	1
It's just ok, camera not better quality and UI is not friendly, I am not set my photo on main screen. Other features are just good speed nice and lastly audio quality is also good noise less.	3
Got a made in China phone. So much for trying to support Indian brands...	1
Defective.. Video call is not clear and audio too	1
Guys, I bought this product on first sale. Till today it was good woth money I thought, but since yesterday my back camera stopped working in the sence it is only showing front camera flip to back camera is not working. Please suggest me how to fix... Thanks in advance.	2
Best Mobile with best features at this price....it's an Indian brand.....beats the Chinese products.....don't encourage Chinese brands likeMI & Lenovo.....use Indian brands	5
I have received this phone today in the evening and I m just fed up of it.Suffering from a lot of sim card issues like sim not detecting or lost network.The phone is lagging a lot. I am not abe to call anyone every time I have to reboot my phone.And EARPHONE is no working at all.I want to return this product today itself.Update: I have requested for replacement on 9th as there is no direct return policy.The other phone was also not working properly. So now I have returned the producAND GOT REFUND.	1
Bhut acha product h or company k brands se to kaafi acha h	5
Good phone.i am iPhone user but this pH is a replica of iPhone 10 almost	5
I have purchased it from 1st sell. Back camera is average.But there is nothing like infinity or bassel screen. It's normal. It's only become mamu type of people...	2
Amazing camera and display.Battery lasts for complete day. India ka S8.	5
I wasn't happy with the delivery as phone was received after 2days from expected delivery date and that too after calling their service center 3 times..When I received the package and opened it, I was flattered by the look of the mobile..keeping it small...overall the performance of the phone was nice comparing to other brands at this range.Camera- 9/10 details are quite nice..even after zoomingSound - 7/10 is similar to other phonesDisplay - 10/10 nice display..feels like a premium phone..also visible under bright sunlightBuilt - 8/10 - avg nicePerformance (non-gaming) - 8/10 - no lag nothing else.. took some time to open Gmail and contacts..maybe due to it was syncing at that timePerformance (gaming) - 7/10 - if you play normal games like coc, CR, NFS etc then no issue..but when play games like modern warfare then it heats up and lag.Overall (for the price range) 8/10- nice phone and first phone made by micromax not rebranded.	5
Hopeless phone, and worst amazon customer care center.	1
Very very bad product, many time goes to hang or not working properly spicily touch pad not working on time to time.	1
Worst mobile.  Lot of problems  , no proper customer service no exchange or return option.  Don't buy such stupid mobiles.	1
Bad product	1
A great smartphone from Micromax, infinity display on a budget. This infinity display are mostly on high end phones but, Micromax did a great job bringing budget or value for money phone with this display.I'm very happy with the smartphone.	5
Best budget smartphone but processing is little bit slow hang too much	2
Don't buy	2
I'm interested in buying Micromax infinity White Colour coming chances are there	5
Proximity sensor problem in this..After purchaging two days...when i calls someone..screen automatically off..and blank..utill call finished by someone..so don't buy it totally waste of money and time..	1
Cameras are goodNoticeable laggingThe charger which I got along with this is horrible. Kept for 2 hours, charge increased from 32% to only 57%.	3
One of best features... But battery was not acceptable... Low mah then other mobiles...but remaining all are excellent	4
This is a BJP phone...shocked, I am telling this because this phone has a pre-installed apps called "Narendra Modi". You can uninstall that but after restart it will automatically reinstall.	3
Gorgeous budget Mobile awesome features , but only problem is screen.will break easily.camera excellent	4
Camera is ok but the phone hangs so much.even while playing a 300mb game. I just wasted my money on this phone.	1
Worst phone no replacement	1
It's is good for the infnity display. If you want to experience infinty display you can give a veiw on this..	5
Worst phone with poorest system ui....hangs whenever connected to any wifi or internet connection.....when task manager opened it hangs and switch off.Worst phone from Micromax....not expected that..	1
More than decent for the price point of 10000	5
Awesome is the word that explains this phone	5
Surely I will rate this one of the worst product from micromax, hell of my tenure with this mobile, damn waste of Rs.10,000/- please never think of this mobile in dream also.	1
Mobile hanging.  Having some problems also.Service center not supported. Amazon people also not help to me.totally I'm  disoppinting to buy this mobile.	3

It's seems that I have been cheated.... I m not going to order any from Amazon again.. if I help me in this matter than it will be great.....	1
Have been using this phone for over a month and have faced zero issues. The display is just amazing and rest you all can figure..	5
Simply WOW  mobile....best camera and amazing experience with this phone...This is the best buy with 9,999.Just go for it...	5
Bought the phone for its camera and display.. bt see the truth.. the camera app sometimes doesn't work.. it neither clicks photos nor delets them.. its berry irritating.. i need to reboot it all the time.. I hope Amazon see in this matter..	3
How to book....	3

OVER HANGED AND OVER HEATING MOBILE PLEASE DONT BUY	1
Micromax service fees is good but for gaming it is not that great but overall display is awesome ok for budget. after 21/9/17 today I went to service centre my loud speaker cracking sound worst experience they didn't now about infinity model they refuse to service my handset. Customer support is saying go from vijayawada capital of Andhra Pradesh  to Visakhapatnam 500km to service normal city Micromax is bogus company Chinese scrapDon't buy b	1
Micromax has built a nice phone after a long time.Also included a fingerprint sensor which lg has not provided. Processor is littoe bit average but not bad. Performence is good. Screen is 720p. Cameras are average. Overall a nice phone . Not for gamers.for basic users and little gamers.	3
Best phone for daily use. I got it for my father.	5
Not good very slowly working	1
Its only 9999 on everywhere	1
this is very bad purchase.... applications keep downloading again and again even though i delete them.. the fingerprint  scanner is okay but nothing great... the infinity display which is the USP is a mess, its not at all a infinity display and is just a normal display.  ... it is not at all what pictures show us... cameras with 13 MP and 16 MP is as good as a 5 MP and 8 MP.please do not buy this at all.	1
Very good phone in all things display weight is good light weight camera supper duper	5
Fantastic product. Ahead of his time. Will definitely give a run for moneyTo other Chinese handsets company.	5
To be very frank, the product looks really good and that's it. Nothing else really makes it worth buying.1. Display is huge, and as described the screen to body ratio makes it look good. But the low resolution of 720p hits the main USP of the device.2. UI is a complete Chinese crap. I don't see even a tiny bit of work that has gone into making of the UI. The whole UI design is totally inspired, you can even call it copied, by iOS. Even the tiniest of things like icons are not original. The UI is very sluggish, and I don't seem to see that Micromax is even slightly concerned with their costumers experience with their so called "COMEBACK PHONE", which is one of the main reasons I hate this phone.3. You'll some times feel that you are using a decade old phone with low performing hardware. Its feels like there is no coordination between the Snapdragon 625 and the Chinese crap UI. You'll surely not enjoy the roughness in the UI.4. Cameras are acceptable considering the price at which they are offered.5. Battery seems to be average.	1
Worst quality.....camera is absolutly waste	1
Battery low camera Goot	4
Screen turns on after 10seconds when I pressed power button.Never seen charging reaches morethan 60% even after over night charging also.Amazon is royally robbing people money with that worst smartCHK app.	1
Nice product in this price range. Amazing Features..Decent camera..No hanging..Good battery backup..	5
Camera is not good..	1
Must Buy, awesome phone in this range-Looks like Iphone7fully loaded with good GUI.	5
Its a nice phone. How good it is depends upon each persons daily use. I would say its money worth.	4
Worst mobile ever...just want to say cheated by Micromax...never trust an Indian company as they used to selling craps...first 6 days no problem, gradually started after that..phone turns on automatically while charging,hangs during phone call...telling the lie that promised here for 24 hour assistance..and the bpo person saying service center me le ke jaiye...sasta phone lenewalo ke time bhi sasta hota hay...ye phone lo aur chutia bano...Micromax ke sath chutia bano phone ke sath....	1
Not a Good Phone.Phone Hang on 3GB Ram,Network is major issue with this device.13MP camera is not that clear.Not worth of money	1

Not functioning properly.Not able to surf net. Even no media file is opening. PL call back want to return this item	1
Srry to say ...but I'm unhappy that time with Micromax ...camera is so blurry and display infinity but not brighter and  resolution very poor	1
Do not buy this product, Micromax is a big cheater. This model is totally different from what they have advertised or shown in the picture. This is not a bezel less phone.	1
I want this  phone But not buy	5
This is very disappointing phone in terms of camera quality, Display, and battery. If you are selfie lover than this is not one for you. Even when I ask Amazon to refund my hard earned money they simply told that there is no policy for the refund.	1
I don't purchase China made. I purchased today but learnt from Utube and Guggle that it is made in China and packge shows it made in China. China has occupied Indian land in 1962 war. Again supporting n funding Pak.	1
Very good and camera clarity is awesome	3
This mobile very very poor and toomauch cost don't purchase and no full vision,also no feature, performance came also very bad 16 mega	1

msstttt	5
Good product	5
Good phone for this price.	5
Value for money	5
At this price rate this phone best...when you  will update it...this phone will work more faster and well...a little copy of I phone... Look is killer.. and camera quality is also at fire level.. my friend Mi and oppo hangovers in front of Micromx canvas infinity... Phone is best as compared to cost of phone... I my views phone is best.. some people expect tooo much in this cost but phone is best at its level....  #Amazon and #Micromax .....good deal.. i liked it...	5
Phone performance is very good.. Btry is long lasting...  And micromax earphone are bass beast.. Above expectations.	4
Best Indian mobile in Rs 9999 working as expected. Removable battery+Front Flash Light+16MP Selfie Camera.	5
Camera is superb, best part is screen it 5.7'' but size of the phone is smaller or same as of 5.5'' phone. As per battery is concern with normal use come more than 24h.Overall this time micromax done their job well.	5
Update: "Possibly the worst phone I have ever bought. It keeps installing software by itself. Can't turn off this app centre which keeps sending notifications and installing all kinds of apps. So irritating."Processor is not the best, notice some heavy apps are little slow, but general day to day performance is good. Does the job.Camera is pretty impressive for the price. Software portrait mode works sometimes, sometimes not. Need good lighting for it. When it works its nice. Is there on front and back cameras.Lightweight. Good screen. Only 720p but 18:9 is sweet. Battery is quite good. I get 5.5 hours SoT every time.Better processor would have been killer but overall very happy at this price.	2
After using it for a month almost looks like you can blindly opt for this at this price range. With 3 GB of RAM it's good for multitasking. No heat issues yet and also the performance seems to be flawless.	5
Extremely fast phone in low price. Phone looks awesome without cover. Body is made up of aluminum and plastic makes phone cool while using 4G. Because of long & slim body I don't need to use my other hand. 128 GB is too much for my heavy duty (lossless) song list. And Sound out put is very good. But ear phone with handset is not great but good. Must take it before offer is over on Amazon.  Thanks for Amazon in One day delivery.	5
Good phone.good look. I have used more than 3 month. No heating. Camera is average. battery is only 2900 is the only fault i feel. Overall great product	5
Owsome Phone.. Value for money...Best phone .. Great Features...Finger Lock is Super Fast.. Many More Features than Phones costing more than 16k...	4
Initially while going through the comments I wondered that many people Have write a negative review but now I realised that it is a worst phone hanging issues touch sensor not work ing properly .rear camera is of poor quality while we switched it to video mode .touch is also poor . initially I have wrote a good comment after using it for 3month I found this much of complaints .so dear friends don't buy this phone.choose another brand pleeees don't buy it's a request	1
i have been using it now for 10 days....good mobile in this price...MADE IN INDIA...Micromax we love you...good camera ...best camera in 9.5K ...good internet connectivity...touch screen is good...fone looks good...all the features that u get in a 15k mobile,you are getting it in around 9.5K price in this......Long live India...Long live Made in India Micromax..Jai Hind	5
The phone looks premium. No issues. Good at 10k. The display is not the best though.	5
Good Phone at this budget.1st Time Micromax Sell a Good Product with All Satisfying Specifications.Good performance,good camera quality,good and large infinity display like Samsun,and battery performance be good.I definitely recommend for this phoneGuys Must Buy This phone.	5
This smartphone doesn't serve the basic purpose of a phone which is dialing and receiving calls. The voice is never clear. I would like to return the same.	1
Amazing product by micromax ,it's very impressive and stylish phone under 10000.why this phone is best just sree.1.infinity display 18:9 it's awesome .2.front camera with flash and portrait mode 3.smart gesture.4.Smart action.5.finger print sensor.In this range it's awesome it's unbeatable.	5
Surprise package from Micromax,I am not expecting such a good phone in this price range from Micromax, display looking is stunning,phone performance is also good.batery back up is good for normal user.and thanks for Micromax for great product in this price range.please buy it because of an Indian company compete to Chinese on quality.	5
Awesome product. Only complaint is that the soft buttons for home, recent and back are occupying space from the promised 18:9 screen. This is only happening when any app is open. Home screen (Desktop) looks perfect. This is such a minor issue, that I do not want to reduce the rating for the overall product.Best buy, for the price...	5
I have been using this phone for last 10 days and below are my comments on this phone:Pros:1. Display is good with vibrant colors while using camera and watching videos/movies2. Battery lasts easily for a day3. Jio sim works without any issue4. Good phone in the price segment of INR. 10000/-5. Good looking phoneCons:1. Speaker output and quality could have been better2. Display brightness could have been better as visibility is poor in sun/outdoor conditions even with full brightness settings!3. Restarting the mobile takes almost 80 to 90 seconds - May be software needs fine tuning4. Audio of the videos recorded from front camera is very poor! Rear camera audio is good but lacks optical image stabilization.5. The UI could have been better. Today I got an an SMS on software upgrade/patch available but System Update doesn't reflect the same - I am unsure on how to upgrade!Apart from these, there is no clear cut details on how to get 30gb JIO offer and 375/- Kindle books free offer!Also looking for good tempered glass with back case but couldn't find one.	4
My self is the early buying of this product, Nice product in this cost, Processor speed, Both the Camera( Front & Rare) is also very good,With Internet life of battery is upto 8-9 hours, without internet amost 15-18 hours. Easy to handle in bigger screen also.Nice product	5
I give 5 stars and excellent to Micromax infinity. I am a loyal customer of Micromax shifted from Micromax a114 to infinity. Micromax made a master piece at such pricing which is worth buying. I find lot of clarity on voice calls, high speed connectivity on 4g and clean, simple user interface. Super phone at this price range.	5
The phone is really awesome. Touch is so smooth ,Front Camera is the best but the back one is not so good like front, buts it's fine,I don't like its own theme launcher so I changed it to another launcher, Battery wise its good, its don't have quick charging option still it charges the phone very fast, while buying this I was thinking about phone resolution is too low but the display quality is very good I couldn't find a lot diff bw 1080px screen and its screen	5
Both Camera is goodBattery is good one dayDisplay is fine but not full hd feel like 5 inch display.Sometimes apps close automatically...Sound is very slow and very bad sound quality....	3
All the features are good, performance of mobile is also good but when it's about battery is very poor because if you using mobile constantly 3 hours this mobile battery get low but in this mobile the problem is there only of battery .All the things are made good and screen look fab. People should buy this mobile and use it.	4
Performance is very good. The brand is Micromax, though comparing with other Chinese brands, the smartphone's hardware is quite good. The battery backup is awesome. Using Jio 4g 24 hrs. in 1st slot with data on all the time & Idea 3g in the other, the device is giving at about 20 hrs. of back up in average. I haven't tried any games yet. But watching movies online, listening music, browsing web & of course using facebook, what'app very heavily, the phone is running flawlessly & without any lag. Snapdragon 425 SOC is impressive. Though it is quad core processor, I haven't felt any lagging till date. It should be noted that the phone has a great camera both rear and front. The front camera has flash also and it is quite good. Last of all the display is 5.7 inches with 18:9 ratio which looks charming. The device is slim & feels premium although the back cover is made of plastic. I must tell that, nobody would regret after purchasing this one in the 10k range Indian brand.	5
Built quality of this phone is pretty good and battery doesnt drain easily; moderate usage will get you more than a day. but in terms of specs it still lacks behind many other brands like  xiomi, lenovo, honor, Asus etc at the price point. Its camera disappoints very much in low light. In fact lenovo k3 note's camera is much better than infinity display even though it came in 2015. Also Asus phones at 9000bucks launched earlier shoots much better. what is good about this phone is that  there is no heating issue.	3
After 10 days screen got damaged and now Micromax saying that this not under warranty and demanding Rs. 3850 this is very bad . So I suggest all of you do not purchase this product.	1
As per the price phone is good. What else can you expect. Phone performance is good. It's working fine. But the camera could have been better front & back both.	4
After using it heavily for 3 days.....Battery as its 2980mah is performing quite wellInfinity bezel less screen will be one of the great exp under 10kFront cam(16 mp) is better than rear cam(13 mp) *selfie loversBoth front n rear flash works wellUI could have been better but its niceFingerPrintSensor works 7to8 times in 10One of the good thing is u can use two sims and a memory card as well there is a separate slot for memory card and also battery is removable*in any emergency cndition u can take out ur batteryOverall if u see this is one of the best phn under 10k. So if ur budget is under 10 got for it.	4
Phone is very light in weight and handy. Cool in Look wise. No hang issue & rear and specially  front camera are good as expected in this mid range phone. Totally satisfied with the gaming performance of phone and with given specifications of phone. Using it for last one and half month. Under 10k price range this phone with given specifications is best to  buy for Casual use.	4
First of all its an Indian brand that's why I gave 4 star. Micromax need to improve battery and processor of Hs2 mobile. Need to improve quality. Looks are great.	4
this is a good phone. job well done micromax. i like the cover which came in the box. very nice.	4
Best budget phone in the market i suppose...,wrks great....never hangs.....battery backup is amazing.....touch is smooth .....recommended budget phone....	5
Pathetic phone! I need to return it but these Amazon people have lots of testing process. And i am not able to place a return because of these nonsense process. The phone gets heated up within some hours and battery charge drains in some mins drastically. It is pathetic. Please help return me that product.	1
Hangs when internet is switched on. selfie cam is grt. Rear camera is not so much. Could have included a better battery with much higher mAh power. Ram is not that bad, except when connected to net. Not beselless. It has bezels	2
Do not buy this phone please....horrible experience.Just a month and it started to hang.The touch did not work and applications like the camera started to operate on its own. Writing this review from their support centre in Malleshwaram,Bangalore as they refuse to replace this phone and offered to just change the touch. Who would want the camera of their phone and especially the front camera to operate on its own and whenever it wants. Please stay away from MICROMAX. I wish i could rate them zero.	1
gets slow sometimes but otherwise the piece is good.THE SCREEN IS AWESOME	4
Lovely phone with lovely features at lovely price. Love it! Excellent camera, no heating issues, good battery life and fast...	5
First hand experience is superb.Super handling n features for the range n price.WoW product from Micromax.	5
Nice phone doesn't hangFingerprint scanner is quite fastSpeed of the phone is good like a high budget smartphoneDual sim works properlyComplely satisfied with the phoneThe best you can get with this price	5
this mobile getting problem also cannot able to hear the sound and volume total very less	1
	5
Battery is a weak point, but then its decent enough for a backup of 1day. Front cam is amazing. If you are not going for Redmi, this is the best alternative for a 10k budget. I would still rate Redmi better than  Canvas infinity	4
Nice mobile	5
Remember to read all specs.It lag while playing heavy games even on the first day. But if you are not into gaming very much then it is a good option. And the 18:9 aspect ratio looks so beautiful.	3
Excellent Effort and Excellent Result by Micromax.Phone is dead gorgeous. From all sides.Beautiful and crisp displayLean form factor. Easy to handle.2.5D curved glass adds to the beautySnappy to the core. No Lag.Cameras, both back and front are good. Especially the front cam is exceptional. Images taken are crisp, detailed and accurate coloured.Just one drawback. Back camera performance under low light conditions is more desirable.I'm not comparing with any other similarly priced phone, because there is no match on many fronts. Simply don't go after spec sheet only.Best buy for the price offered.If you need a beautiful phone inside out...... just get it.Highly recommended.	5
I used this smartphone for couple of weeks and after using i am writing some details about this.----------------------------------Design and build quality-----------------------------------The 18:9 screen is good. it looks stylish while holding in hand. The back panel is removable means it do not have metal back panel. The look and feel at the back is good as compare to the budget. I feel some problem while removing its back panel. it is hard to remove the back panel. This phone has a 720p disply which is not full HD. After watching three movies on it and playing games the screen seems good. I tested the fingerprint sensor speed by observig the time it takes to unlock.------------------------------------Performance of the phone-------------------------------------It has snapdragon 425 processor with 32 GB of the storage. After playing 4-5 games I can say that process sir is ok. While playing Asphalt 8 and NOVA like games I feel that this phone struggle a little bit. The phone has Android nogut 7.1.2 which is the latest nuget version. The battery life of this phone is good but not the best. After charging it fully it gives me 9 hours of backup. It can vary according to your uses.-------------------------------camera --------------------------------The camera is not greatest. It does a decent job. I took some photographs in daylight condition from the back camera. The camera captures decent images. I also took some photographs in the low light condition or in night. In night the photos are not great. The photo come blurry a little bit. I took some selfies from the 16 megapixel front camera. The front camera captures quality images.-------------------------------Battery------------------------------The battery of the smartphone is average. It has 2900 MH battery. This battery can give you 9 to 10 hours of backup. Basically the battery backup depends on the uses. The battery backup reduces when you play high end games and watch movies.-------------------------------Ram management and storage--------------------------------It has 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage. For a normal user that 32 GB storage is enough. Talking about the RAM management it has 1.5 GB of RAM free. The RAM is optimised. While multitasking it is lag free.--------------------------------Inbox content---------------------------------silicn coverscreen guardbasic cablechargerbasic earphoneuser manual	4
Camera & battery quality is bestBt phon is hang there more than 4 tym hanged in 12 daysHang tym no recive or make phone calls  then put battery open then on & make callThen best my previous phone Letv le 1s ecoIn 1 year is no hang single tym	3
excellent mobile but it better if battery is more powerful at least 4000 mAh.	5
An excellent phone. Absolutely delighted! The fingerprint functions is great and the fact that it has an additional slot for sd card is a winner feather. So you have 2 sims plus sd unlike many other phones. VoLTE too...	5
Poor battery life but excellent selfie camera( not in low light).	3
Good Phone by Micromax	5
Awesome	5

Nyyc product liked by everyone....	5
Superb phone 	5
Delay Delivery .  Phone is perfect according to price .both camera great . Only one issue i faced is that sometimes it hang for 5-6 seconds ( when i on mobile data )  otherwise phone is perfect .	4
I'm using this phone since last 25days & there is not a single problem with it	4
With the price segment of 10k micromax has done a decent job to get a better phone.Dedicated Memory ,SIM slot, Removable battery were advantageous.Screen is awesome and with HD screen battery life is very good. I don't bother a FULL HD display miss in this phone.Front facing camera is awesome.Users might face camera glitches, Install OPEN Camera app from playstore, this will solve yourr camera quality issues.Performance is better in this phone. I would suggest to keep minimal apps like stock Android version to have the best experience.Recommended phone for 10K segment buyers. All is well with Canvas Infinity.	5
Nice phone and long time battery backup camera quality nice clearly picture take	5
OK... NOT FITTED IN POCKET.. SLOW RAM	3
What's App Not Working	2
The phone is sexier to look at and performance is upto the mark... recommendable.	4
Battery is not good	3
nice product	5
Phone performance is average, phone is hanging and mis behave sometime, rear camera quality is not good.	3
I using this phone since last 2 days. It's not good time review the product but yet I am doing mean I am excited to rate this phone..Pros:=========================Display: As advertise the main feature of this phone is it's Full Vision Display 18:9 Infinity Screen. Excellent. Since now a days this feature is trending and almost other brand eg. Vivo, LG, Samsung are trying to bring this feature into their smartphone. Micromax had did well. Gaming experience is fantastic. Playing video is also a new experience. Good job in making the display. Looks a quality product.Design: is also batter, Size of the phone is same as 5" display phone. so it best fits in the pocket. weight is also not so high.Camera:Selfie camera is awesome, you can't stop your self to have selfie when you open the camera. selfie flash is available. Image quality is also good. seconder camera is average.Fingerprint sensor: Fingerprint sensor is good. you can set it to open applications you have install. apart from locking/unlocking.Non Hybrid: Best feature. Actually I'm not getting why smartphone manufacture adding hybrid slot. Is it a feature? no it's a hassle.Battery: Removable 2900 mAh. battery is bit low capacity but yet phone last long 1 day with fair use. (eg music/gaming/surfing)Other: Got in-ear Earphone and transparent back cover. (Cheap company like MI not providing)Cons:===========Only mate Black color is availableDesign is slim so may be you it fell from your handProvided Screen Guard has no use.Overall: I was looking for this kind of budgeted phone from reputed or India brand from so long. Actually it is batter than Redmi phones. you can trust Micromax at least after this piece.Strongly Recommended	5
Noice	5
Value for money..	5
Thanks.	5
Received micromax canvas infinity yesterday...the phone is getting heated up within 5 mins of use	1
Worth the money......	4
Very good phone,superb camera with 32x zooming system	5
Excilent mobile	4
Looks awesome.Performance greatCamera good.Selfie flash.	5
nice	5
Nothing like it for this range! No regret.	5
As described	3
REAL GREAT PRODUCT. Do buy and has real good camera and display	5
It's like dream come true, as this infinity is just awesome.	5
Micromax has nailed it with this phone.Looks - Phone looks great, classy black, smooth 2.5D curved glass, additional screen protector and transparent back cover is also providedDisplay - It is a gorgeous 5.7 inch display.  My phone display has a slight bluish tint and I couldn't find a way to change color calibration. Probably a software update in the future can solve  this. This Phone is increased in height, so it feels very slim and comfortable to hold.Camera - Best camera in this segment, specially the front camera. Picture quality is much better than Redmi Note 4.Performance - With SD 425 processor and android 7.1.2, it feels silky smooth for your average day work. However if you are a gamer it does lag while playing games like Subway Surfers. Don't know if it is a softaare issue or just my set has this problem.Battery - 2900 mAh battery gives you plenty of juice for a day running with average usage.Connectivity - Dual sim 4G, has a good reception, not the best, even in low signal area like inside of a building.Does not have 5GHz ac wifi capability, which is a little bummer as it is being increasingly the norm.Sound - sound output through speaker is quite loud and quality sound. So you won't miss a call. Output through headphone is also clean, much better than Redmi Note 4. You will love it.Overall, Looks is great, and adequate performance for days multitasking work, sufficient battery life, smooth near stock android Nougat experience is a plus point.	4
Mobile is very good in its price segment.	4
Very nice phone with great display. Bought it for just 9999 - 10% cash back (would come down for 9000) . My detailed review:Pro's:--Great display , it's same size of 5.5 inch phone but had 5.7 inch display.--The cheapest phone with 18:9 display till now.--Very nice UI and smooth one. Will have lot of resemblance to iOS.-- Doesn't have blotware and it pretty fast whole operating . And no heat as such for normal usage.--dedicated slot for memory card, i.e 3 slots of which 2 are for sim and 1 for memory card--removable battery, this is a good feature as if any battery issues in future can just replace it.-- front camera or selfie camera is just good--Battery performance & optimization , with just 2900 mah battery it almost coming for 1.5 to 1 day for  normal or slightly above usage respectivelyCons:--The chipset is octa core 1.4Ghz 425 Qualcomm . Could have increased the price a bit and had a better processor. Not a major con for normal use or slightly heavy use . But not a ideal one for heavy gamers and heavy users.--The one thing disappointed is the rear camera department , the photos are fine and very good in day light .  But with lot of competition from China company mobiles with dual camera setup , this is one place where micromax can improve a lot.Even if price increased by a 1000 is fine if had good dual camera with depth perception.--Battery capacity is just 2900, should have been great if had atleast 3400 or above mah . Bigger battery is always a plus with bigger screen of 5.7 inch. But can compromise on this front as not a major issue.Overall micromax had come back in style with lot of competition from China company mobiles . But if it had dual rear camera this would have been a killer phone under 10000 bucks .. the 1 star is decreased just for that	4
camera quality is not good.	1
Display is very dim.	2
Very good phone	4
Awesome but ram is less	4
I'm using Canvas Infinity from last one month and completely satisfied with it.Recently I've clicked my Rajasthan Tour with it and attached pics. For ur reference.Also Thanks Amazon team for ur superb service.Without any doubts Just Go for it.	5
Nice phones..	4
Its my 3rd phone from amazon, first one was Yureka, 2nd one - Redmi 2 prime and 3rd one - Infinity. And I move from my Samsung galaxy on8 to Micromax infinity. 2nd best phone after Yureka I'm using. But I'm little disappointed due to its 720p HD screen. And bcoz I used to Samsung amoled screen and Samsung best camera. All I can say Infinity display is Good not expected full hd with in 10k and Camera only good in beauty mode. You can see d difference btw photos as well. Speaker Sound is good not too loud like Redmi note 4 and headphone sound is awesome. Front Camera with selfie flash done its job well. Fingerprint is also working quite fast not like Sharma ji told , with in a second it will unlock your device. All in one it's a budget oriented Device. Check i took screen shot under the sun light "KBC" with 30%of screen auto brightness & 2nd photo from rear camera.	4
Best 'made in India' Mobile with extraordinary features. Awesome camera. Thank you Micromax	5
Snapdragon 425 quad core should be replaced with snapdragon 435...And in build image enhancing software is poorest...Battery does not last long..Screen is goodCamera is goodContact and call screen should be separated and various apps create their own contact list which should not be added.Brightness control does not work well.	2
One of the best full screen utility phone at this price. Not the best for games and camera is 'good' compared to premium phones, but if you are career person, you wouldn't have any complaints.	5
The display produce true colour, speaker sound is loud and clear ear phone and earphone sound is great.	5
Very slow, not good choice	1
Some times fingerprint scanner is not working..again re taking finger scan..	3
Advice: buy micromax instead of apple 8 and donate the rest of the money. Result: better phone than apple 8 and u will have all the blessings..	5
*GOOD PHONE*INBUILT CAMERA APP IS NOT GOOD (GRAINY IMAGES, NO MANUAL CONTROLS POSSIBLE) THOUGH IT HAS SOME GOOD FEATURES*CAMERA WORKING GREAT WITH 3RD PARTY APPS*LAG WHILE SWIPING FROM NOTIFICATION PANEL	4
After 10 days of usage I an writing this review:Pros:1.Good touch with better display2.Battery backup is good3.camera both front and rear good.4.No heating problem5 No lag in normal usage.I don't know abt games.Cons:1 Fingerprint recognition is working for anybody (even unregistered fingers)which is a serious glich.2.Does not accept hd videos.	2
Switching off automaticallyBad experienceFingerprint sensor is worstI think Micromax is back again.  but its back to go back	1
Better selfie camera front flash is gives very nice quality..5.7 display is awesome but not luking 5.7 .overall behtreen phone in this segment budget no one can defeat it.....	4
Good phone not excellent. Depends the price it's meet the quality.main new experience is the display.Compare to LG q6 3 times better.Good camera. Good display. Performance more than average. Battery around 8 to 9 hours (with WiFi and 4g/3g) average fingers scanner.no heating issues. Changing time also average.A full display phone with a good price and good specifications.	4
i bought for family only drawback no full hd and bad processorbeautiful phone take too long too charge but atlast micromax came up with something better	4
So far good...Nice screen display...good finger sensor...good front camera...overall for the price,a good deal...not a gaming enthusiast,so no comments on that...rest after using it for a month..	4
awesome product battery is good camera also super screen vary nice, totally very good phone	5
Too much Hanging problem after store data on internal memory, about two minutes hang, difficult to unlock and pick calls. Some times need to restart (direct battery pull)  for using handset.also refund take too long time about a month...less then one star option is not available.	1
Pros:1. Good camera and full display with nice priceCons: doesn't look like 32 gb memory phone gets stuck while net is on and sms will not show also 3gb ram looks likes only 1 gb not up to the mark recommended phone not for heavy usage only normal ones	3
Best cell phone from micromax at that price.	5
Worst phone full garbage of money..for more information contact me 6shivam98@gmail.com..onky look is good.	4
It's not good.  This may smaller than 5.7 inches	1
good	5
Don't buy any micromax product. Service is extremely bad. They have Service centers only to extort money. If you submit your device it won't come back as same. They take out perfectly working parts of your device. Micromax doesn't help in this matter at all. They all are crooks. I have been a victim of this. So I advice everyone avoid Micromax.	1
Good product	5
Sofar so good..	4
Camera Quality is not too good	4
Auto call record is not working.	2
Ultimate smartphone in low price	5
Good18:9 screen at a low priceCompactDedicated SIM and microSD card slotsBadDisplay quality is below parCustom UI is buggyPerformance is sluggish	3
Good built qualityCamera is averageNo lag while playing pubg,snyper fury etc.Speaker is averageBattery is awesome,charging time approx 40min from 30% to 100%Its worth for money just go for it.	5
The screen smashed and turned to bits! My motoG was so hardy, I'm disappointed in the quality of this phone.	1
Good and cheapRecommended for those who have a low budget and wants good features of the phone and there many good features of the phone I bought 3months back running good no complaints and I would like to try even the pro version of it. And who give 18:9 ration screen on this budget think and take it and I give it complete 5 stars because I don't have any complaints regarding this phone this is simply awesome just have to improve the quality of screen guard the company gives	5
All over the product is very good. I thanks to Micromax. Wow.	5
Perfect for price what you pay, infinity display makes big difference and processor is not bad for normal day to day task its enough.	5
I am giving this review after one month of usage.. 1st of all purely awsam display..smooth usage, .i am using near about 20 apps with hard apps, no lags. Very fast charging. In this budget i must recommend this phone. Till now nothing disappointed me.	5
I didn't believe in Micromax quality until I used this phone. It's the best Infinity Display phone for a cheaper rice..it's equally lasts with Nokia 5 and 6 in terms of quality	5
Bugs, automatically camera and other app on when mobile unlock. No updates available, accepted camera display quality not good	1
Why not gold or rose gold or any other colour is available other than the black one? Other then a good device in this price range among the best..	5
Slow processor, lags while switching screens even when no apps are open	2
It goes without saying that the gap between phones is getting smaller and smaller. Years ago, phones would either dominate the market, or just simply be forever in the "cheap and acceptable" area for performance and quality etc.Speed and performance:I have to be honest, the performance on this handset is flawless. It is super quick, responsive and hasn't yet lagged at all or dipped in performance in the slightest. I can open the camera quickly (something that other phones struggle with if you're coming from an app), can take a photo and then go back to the app that I was in without any issues at all.Battery:This is my only negative. I have this phone meaning I have the 2900mAh battery within the handset. I am pretty heavy on my phone, and forever checking emails and texting my girlfriend (gotta make her feel loved like haha) so always using it. After starting work at around 9am and finishing at 5, I am usually down to around 20%. I don't find that things such as the camera have such a hard effect on the battery, unless you're filming in, then you start to notice a metaphorical leak so to speak.Screen:My goodness... this is my favorite part. I always thought this bezeless, or at least small bezel thing was a bit of a gimmick, but oh no. I could never go back to a phone that doesn't have this kind of display ever again. This handset, is smaller than other smart phones, but has a bigger screen. Weird, huh? Well, because the screen practically covers the entire phone size, you get a beautiful view and great clarity that is simply gorgeous. Honestly though, the screen is beautiful, I am being very serious when I say that this is the most beautiful screen I have seen on a phone before, and it has completely changed my opinion on how phones should be designed from now on.Camera:The camera is good. It offers good colour reproduction and produces sharp images. I find the video modes are good, and there are modes such as Super pixel Modes meaning you can take control of various controls on your camera. It's a shame that there isn't a dual camera setup, considering that a lot of phones are going that way, but let's be honest, if you're truly wanting to get into photography, then you're going to get yourself a DSLR. This phones camera performs excellently taking nice images and will suit the needs of the majority if not all of the people that use it. Video low light performance is a little bit average, but in well lit environments the colours are beautiful and are exceptionally well complemented by the gorgeous display.Overall:Look, this handset in my opinion is fantastic. But I genuinely think this is a change. The handset offers a beautiful, and I really do mean a beautiful design and great performance meeting many criteria and expectations. I love this phone. Honestly. I am usually so critical of phones and find it hard to settle with one, but so far, this handset is proving to be the best phone. I would definitely recommend.	5
An all-rounder with best in class battery life.Key Highlights:Class leading battery life, ergonomic design and compact form factor, excellent price to performance ratio, best selfie camera performance in low-light situations.Verdict:The Micromax Canvas Infinity is the best smartphone to buy under 10,000. this phone's battery life is the best thing about it. TheMicromax Canvas Infinity can easily last a full day for even the most heavy-duty user, while regular and light users can expect anything over a day and a half, or more. The camera is acceptable for this price range, while the performance is best in class as well.The Experience:The Micromax Canvas Infinity proved to be quite an ideal smartphone for anyone looking for a compact smartphone that is affordable but doesn't cut corners in a big way. Right from performance on browsing, social media apps to gaming, the phone never felt slow or out of breath. The battery performance really stands out, with almost 2 days of battery life for moderate users, you really can't ask for more from a smartphone in this price range. The device feels well made in terms of build quality and finish and it easy to use and manage. i recommend the 3GB RAM + 32GB storage (infinity) version, as it has that extra head-room for more apps and smoother multitasking. The camera is perhaps the only area where we expected more from micromax. It clicks good pictures in daylight but isn't able to hold-on to the picture quality in low-light. But then, you can't have it all!	5
Great display quality but performance is medium.	4
I purchased it for myself,really it's worth the money .phone looks very premium	5
Gifted to me bro. It's been 3 months since I bought. Running smooth. Worth for the price 10k.	4

Perfect phone for everyoneBest in all aspects	5
Good mobile but it hangs some time	4
I didn't purchased this phone but I recieved it as a gift from my brother. As he know I was a big fan of Micromax. So he attempted this to make me suprise. After receiving this product I was really amazed that Micromax can still compete with the current giants. Now explaining it's features.1. First one to go with infinite display in India.2. Exceptional front camera.3. Ok ok back camera.4. First phone with Snapdragon from Micromax.5. Performance good.6. Storage and RAM also good.7. User interface is also awesome.8. Battery is sufficient if fast charging was added.9. Expandable memory nice work.10. Removable battery don't know why and no hot plug support.Overall at this price point with infinite display and very good front camera, best possible built quality no log in performance. I just love this phone .Thank You Micromax. GooD JoB	4
Pros of Micromax Infinity:Good looking 18:9 ratio dispaly (rounded borders)Decent Performance16MP front camera24 hours Service or ReplacementCons of Micromax Infinity:Mediocore Display ResolutionRear camera is averageBuild quality is average	4
I am writing this review after 6 months from the Purchase date.Coming from the windows phone background and since it is my first Android device :This is a fabulous device but I was a bit sceptical in the beginning whether or not should I buy it. Trust me guys this device met all the Expectations. It is obviously not a high end device but yes it did all the multitasking that I was looking for. There are usually 526 applications which are always open the background which includes WhatsApp, my email client, My Airtel App, Facebook app etc. But despite of running multiple applications this phone neither overheats no shows any sort of hanging issues.The Battery life  - the battery life is simply amazing. Uses phone bit more than average user as I'm into the client servicing profile so this phone is basically a good side kick. After full day use this phone still leaves me with 30% off battery life. For example if I charge my phone at 9 in the morning to hundred percent then this phone leaves me with 30% battery life at 9 at night which is not bad when u  talk about the battery life.The design and make of this phone is quite sleek gives a quiet premium feel when you hold in your hand. The phone is a metal body back cover which is quite durable as well. I have dropped this phone quite many times from my hand and even sometimes while it was in the charging mode, trust me there were no signs of any screen breaking or any dent in the metal body.I must tell you guys that I am not using any tempered glass for my phone, but still my phone screen sustained those drops and showed no cracks or signs. I'm just using the rubber casing, and a screen protector which came along with the phone.The cameras are  fabulous. I would say they are  doing the wonders in the low light but yes overall I would give it 8.5 out of 10.(Both front and back).Overall verdict is that this phone is rubbing shoulders with some of the high and phones in the market.I am planning to gift a new Micromax infinity phone to my wife on our anniversary.	5
I like to buy this phone because Micromax is give 1phone in best price best features ke sath so I am buy or don't buy LG q6 because q6 does not have fingerprint sensor and costly but this phone is all features and low price	5
I got this mobile 10 days before and very much satisfied till now.Front camera quality is very good and rear camera also good.Finger senser is very fast and mobile unlocked in super fast speed.Battery lasts one day and its OK.Mobile is very slim and it is not bulky like other 5.7 inch screen phone.	5
Agar micromax ne ye fone me full hd display diya hota & rear camera zyada acchee dee hoti & processor bhi better diya hota...Sabse main issue ye fone kee battery hai...bahut kum hai......Agar ye sab cheezen micromax solve karde to fir ye fone ko log 15,000 me bhi khareed lenge	5
Excellent performance of the phone will be more than happy to buy one more time . excellent camera phone value for money	5
There are issues in the phone. User experience is very poor. if more that 2 apps are already open... Yahoo mail app do not open!! System update is not downloading at all for file size of 95.x mb. Help center asked to do factory reset!! This is just third month of usage. No games No Video streaming  a very conservative use and this is the state of the phone!!! So please do read more reviews before thinking of waste of investment of Rs. 9999/- to be precise!!	2
Best smartphone , clear camera better battery backup,faster performance and good looking, made in India	5
Don't buy	1
Awesome phone do go for it INDIAN BRAND..	5
Good phone but not soo good...battery, charging port, ram management, performance are all average not soo good u can judge urself wen compared to other phones in this price range	3
Priced at Rs. 9,999, the Micromax Canvas Infinity tries to bring an 18:9 display to the budget market. While we have to commend Micromax for trying, this phone definitely falls short in many areas. Despite the display being this phone's highlight, it is also its biggest disappointment. The My Launcher skin is buggy and performance is sluggish. If you're in the market for a sub-Rs. 10,000 Android smartphone, you should look at other options such as the Xiaomi Redmi 4 , Moto G5 , Nokia 5, or Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 , all of which have better hardware at around the same price. If you still want a smartphone with 18:9 display just because it's something new, then you should save up some money and go for the LG Q6  instead.	4
First I gave to congratulate Micromax for their good effort. Now let's come to the point --1. It's made in China, not our country India. Micromax being Indian co., the handset should be manufactured in our country.2. Look of the handset is quite different from the online advertisement photos. I think it is not bezelless phone.3. You are giving 5.7" screen, then it should be full HD. There is no meaning of 1440720 pixels.4. Now a days, battery should be at least @ 4000 mah.Thanks for reading my points. If you agree than pls. like it.	4
Don't buy from micromax worst build quality and the phone will have a lot of problems and will become unusable after a few months.	1
Initially i gave 5 stars and trusted this brand. It was very tight to plug in and out of the charger. Neglected and continued to use as I thought it might be a new phone and gradually it will be ok to use  But now frequently I find charging issue with this phone. Now not at all charging in two months. the phone is otherwise good model slender and sleek desgn, software updates often given - install or ignore it. These software updates didnt help out my charging problem so it is hardware issue. don't know how much time  the chennai  service centre would take. Have sent mail to info@micromaxinfo.com.will update the consequences later.	2
Don't go for this. Completly trap. No accesories available in online and out side too. Camera 3. Display 3 . Battery 3.5. softwares 2.5	1
Here is a detailed review of Micromax Infinity to help you make your purchase. Do leave a helpful vote :)Reasons to Buy Micromax Canvas Infinity (Pros and Advantages):1. The first reason to go with it is for the noticeably massive 5.7 inch screen. This is not the first time the company has designed a huge display device. The resolution is a bit odd for it is of 7201440 pixels which holds a pixel density of 279 ppi (pixels per inch). I wish the resolution is full HD as it will have better pixel density and clarity. Anyway the aspect ratio is 18:9 which translates to 2:1 and I would say its very tall, kind of reminds me the Galaxy S8. The brightness level seems decent with good amount of saturation and contrast levels.2. Next is that under the hood it comes with Snapdragon 425 chipset which has a 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU. Its a quad-core CPU which has the ability to process any apps without any issues. However I wish it to be an octa-core CPU but for that it will have to come with Snapdragon 625 which will eventually increase its price. You will not face any heating problems or lagging issues even multitasking continuously for longer time. Right now it is a strong competitor to the Motorola Moto E4 Plus.3. The primary memory is of 3 GB which have around 1.6 GB left after initial boot.4. The secondary memory is of 32 GB. It has about 26.2 GB left for the user. There is a memory card slot which can read up to a maximum of 128 GB. And yes it is a dedicated slot with no strings attached.5. For gaming it comes with the Adreno 508 GPU. It can run any graphic intensive apps without any kind of frame drops or lags.6. Another Micromax Canvas Infinity pros is the operating system. Out of the box it runs on Android Nougat version 7.1.2 which is the latest one. Plus the company has also specifically mentioned that it will receive future operating system upgrade to Android Oreo. Thats a huge bonus.7. The camera on the rear comes with a 13 megapixel sensor. The focal aperture is f/2.0 and it can record videos up to a maximum resolution of 1080p at 30 fps (frames per second). Secondary optics is powered by a 16 megapixel sensor which has the same focal aperture as that of the rear camera. The front camera can also record videos in full HD resolution. On both the sides there is an LED flash to deal with low light conditions. Micromax has always been in the decent zone if you ask about the camera quality. The colors, saturation, contrast and brightness are pretty decent.8. On the rear there is a fingerprint scanner which resides just below the camera. The maximum number of fingers it can register is five. It is very sensitive and also quite accurate in recognizing. Takes less than 0.3 seconds to unlock the smartphone.9. Another advantages of Micromax Canvas Infinity is that it supports USB OTG cable. You can connect flash drives and transfer files to and fro.Reasons Not to Buy Micromax Canvas Infinity (Cons, Demerits, Downsides, Disadvantages, Issues and Problems):1. The first problem or cons of Micromax Canvas Infinity is with the battery capacity. For a massive display of 5.7 inches the 2980 mAh battery is really low. I could stand if it is a Samsung or Motorola device, they have better power management algorithms as they tweaks the operating system for better performance. Also there is no fast charging feature. For a normal user its OK not to have quick charge but for avid users it is a must.2. Second disadvantages is the absence of a reputed display protection. It has neither Corning Gorilla Glass, not Asahi Dragontrail Glass. When it will break it will be shattered completely, thats the problem with standard glass protector for the display.3. Another demerits or issues is the absence of compass. How on earth they ignored the compass for the 10,000 price smartphone. Its a must otherwise turn-by-turn navigation with maps is not possible.4. And the last cons of Micromax Canvas Infinity is that it does not have the gyroscope sensor. It is important for connecting VR headsets, running augment reality applications, etc.My Verdict: If you can compromise the cons then its good to go.However, if you can increase your budget I would suggest Redmi 4A.	4
Average quality... Plz dnt buy. Camera is good. Jio sim dnt work properly.. Disply brightness is not good... Wast of money only..	5
Thumps Up for this awesome phone!	5
Great try and failed miserably.Bought this cause of its main attraction "the 18:9 display" . Except that everything is a disaster.Built and body:It's good and looks premium. Having 2.5D curved glass and no Gorilla glass leaves a worry each time I drop the phone.Software:Though the hardware specs looks decent the software UI is sluggish and hopeless. The default launcher is miserable with low amount of customisation options but also hangs whenever other launcher's are used. The surprising thing is SYSTEM UI STOPS SOMETIMES!!! Being a beta user for few apps is a pain in the neck. Almost every alternate update of any app makes the crash and make you vulnerable waiting for another update.The insane thing is Micromax diagnostics checks for crashes and already I have submitted several feedback messages but nothing seems to work (**they don't seem to care**). No OTA updates so far. (*By December 2017*)Camera:Low light camera fails in both rear and front camera. Don't consider the flash in front camera cause it's intensity is so low. No slow motion option. No EIS nor OIS. Super pixel works fine sometimes. Surprisingly front video has a lot better stabilization than back. Both front and back support 1080p videos also lot of noise alike. Daylight photography is fine. Focus on sharp detail is merely impossible how hard you try. Portrait and face beauty are clearly a diversion cause they both fail incredibly.So buy at your own risk.Buying this believing it for an genuine Indian product fooled me good.	1

The phone at first look is an ice breaker at this price ...during the first year everything related to it I'm pressed me weather it is sound quality or features.....but as the first year ended the story took a horrible turn. My phone has now a lot of issues , it's charging speed has slowed down, it didn't charge at once,I have to reinsert the charging pin while charging as it stops charging after some times, it comes out of sleep after pressing the side button a lot of times,and even when I press the side key to lock it ,it makes an emergency number call automatically......etc....etc....And now it has revealed it's face after 1yr so I can't avail for warranty replacement.	2

Good	5
Battery backup is okay, picture quality is bright, and sound quality is moderate. Functions are a bit copy of iPhone X which is unique as compared to other nougat devices. Processor is not too good as phone gets heated up due to continuous use.Screen has no protection glass so once it drops out of hand then in contact with floor or smashing slightly will lead to screen breakage which cannot be replaced.	3
Pros:Good camera quality, battery almost lasts for a day, good display, fingerprint sensor works fine.Cons:Microphone is very poor, it hangs sometimes while multitasking, poor processor.This device is a pure copy of Wiko view.	3

Awesome phone . Buy it guys .	5
Update after 6 months: This phone is a real value for money. I have bought a Sony Xperia xz premium and one Redmi note 5 pro for cousine. When you play YouTube hd videos simultaneously, you realise the diff is negligible. Sony I paid 55k. Photos of Redmi note 5 pro and canvas infinity are comparable(cannot compare the qualities with Sony Xperia xz premium). Audio with the stock headphones also good. No hanging issue so far. Heat is just like any other phone only. Battery is good one day even after switching on the hotspot for many hours. I am not a gamer so that part no idea, bit temple run is running flawlessly. One thing still don't know when they are releasing Oreo as thy declared during the time of launch. Overall very much satisfied what I have paid.Four days of use. Battery lasts only 8 hr medium use with Jio sim and another sim in the slot. Not much app installed. Don't know whether UC browser eats up more battery. I have stopped the notorious Micromax "App Center" notification by denying notification permission. Camera display etc are very good if you are considering the amount you have spend. Though screen display quality is not a crystal clear one but it is color rich. It would have been better if it had better sharpness. Music quality is not  good but call quality is good. So far I am satisfied with purchase for rs 8499	4
Not buying this phone..	1
Nice phone superb camera good processor excellent battery backup front camera is great with selfie flash look is also good back camera has a fair job overall a perfect phone for anyone, but strictly not for gamers,, best camera feature is it has front potrait mode.

Camera zoom not available	1
The Phone is superb & packed with features, The battery is fine,  the removable battery is an advantage  and i am sure the battery will be available freely, the Screen is superb edge to edge resolution  and can be viewed up to 30degrees flawlessly.In the price the phone is sold, it is the Best deal ,  even the best phones these days need to be charged daily to add that 25/50% juice to complete the full charge, Infinity is the right name for this phone  it has it all. pictures are superb and has many options. the transparent back flexible case supplied is a nice protection for camera lens and screen, the sound is clear  for every bit of music (for videos)  Music playback sound depends on the original source, there is a lightsensor activated screen, a three finger pull to save screen short, lifes' going to be a lot easier for a lot of people with this economical and one of the best phones launched by micromax  I have clicked indoor pictures and closeup  but the result will be still better because i have not peeled off the thin plastic on the lens 9 I will do it when I have a proper safety cover, as the lens is slightly above the body, picture 1 and 2 are front camera.  will upload outdoor pictures later...Today as on 29th October 2018  the phone is still going strong i have included a 64 gd memory card.wonder whether its still available	5
