It's a very good choice on a small budget. I tell You Why...Screen -IPS Screen with HD+ (720*1440) Display , It looks very NiceEasy to read in Day Light.Note - Mobile screen has round shape (but screen shot has corners , IDK how)Battery -I have submitted screen shots about battery uses (It is without sim card)It took 19 hours, from 100 percent to 81 percent (with screen on 33 minutes and with no sim card)So in my opinion battery is decent enough for a day useCamera -I have submitted the photo sample . You can check in ti photos . these photos are taken in day lightcamera is good for day light shooting.SoundSound quality is good, in Speaker as well as in earphone (Earphone is not provided with handset)Phone speaker is loud enough to fill a roomOS and UIComes with android version 8.1 UI is Great , Easy to understand.It comes with some unnecessary pre-loaded apps which can be deleted (but not the MI apps)Network CallingI have used it in whatsapp calling only and the voice clarity was good, no issue.I will update my review after 1-2 weeks of use .Recommended ?Yes, Best smart phone according to the budget.	5
Got this few days ago & to say flash sales here at amazon are far better than anywhere else. Atleast you have a chance at getting the thing.Inside box:1. Device2. Usb cable3. Charger4. Sim ejector tool5. Few guidesAbout device, as trend goes, MI phones are value for money always. This ones no exception.1. Screen 9/102. Camera 8/103. Battery 9/104. Performance 7/105. Build 8/10Overall 8.2/10********************Pros1. Refreshing looks with round corners2. Good build quality3. AI gimmick (havent tested it much)4. Full screen gestures, yes in pros as i love them in my Redmi note 5 pro & haing them in low end segment is nice5. No hybrid slot, three separate slots, so 2 sim and extra memory at same time6. Dual 4g standby (enable it in settings->sim cards & mobile net)7. Promised upgrade to MIUI 10 & also a major upgrade of Android8. Plethora of sensors (except IR in specific)9.Cons:1. Performance may be a issue if you are coming from 5A. Having both devices right now, can say, this one is a bit on lower side compared to 5A as far as performance is considered.2. No IR blaster in 6A,  i do use it a lot. Its one the key features for me3. Helio vs qualcomm, & it will really matter in this device4. Camera quality, a bit downgraded compared to 5A5. Too many preloaded apps, though you can get rid of max off them (see below)*****************To uninstall preloaded apps & reduce load on device1. Some can directly be uninstalled from settings->installed apps->select app2. Others, which dont have uninstall option, can be uninstalled via adb-Developer mode on (settings->about->tap on miui version 7 times-USB debugging on (settings->additional settings->developer mode-> usb debugging)-On pc, install adb drivers, (or install MI PC Suite)-connect device-command line->adb devices-pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.xyz.abc (where com.xyz.abc is package name)To list all the packages installed "pm list packages". To get into details, use google or search in xda forumsP.S. Proceed with caution as uninstalling any critical package, may produce error & you will be forced to reset the deviceI was able to uninstall around 30+ apks or packages, including duo, gmail, photos, facebook system services app, google plus, play movies, tts, music, print service, spooler, bug report system, email, google quick search box, payment, gallery, talkback, hybrid, emag, live wallpaper, facemoji, weather provider, personal assistant, mipay, mipicks etc etc.After this, phone was a smooth wrt performance as this will clear some storage and ram usage, by reducing background services.****************Dont understand why, Xiaomi took this decision and downgrade a device, with same price bracket, only a screen & camera upgrade is there. They could have kept same qualcomm processor.FINAL VERDICT:If you already have 5A, then 5A to 6A wont be an upgrade though.5A also available at the moment, so you can get 5A instead of this, if you are not so obsessed with round corners of screen and fresh looks. As its a 1 point downgrade as compared to 5A wrt performance & camera.But, if you really want to have a new device & go with current day trend of screen & camera, AI, looks, & can live without IR, its not a bad deal either. It depends on your usage scenario. Refresing device it is.Just some tweaks here and there & it will be good to go.BUT be open to other options available out there, shell out few bucks to avoid cons.	4
Redmi 6A has lag problems. This phone is hanging and lags while using YouTube and browser.Redmi 5A is far better than Redmi 6A. I am regretting on my decision for buying this phone. Not satisfied.	3
Nice phone..	5
Processor is so bad.and not working properly.so please note this point.otherwise redmi 5a processor is so good	1
Don't buy this product. It is not recognizing the second Sim. Its a different and a saperate slot for 2nd sim unlike the other phones  and the phone is not recognizing the 2nd slot. It's better if both the SIM cards are placed in single slot.  Battery backup is very low, you will need to charge twice daily.	1
Too slow go for reminder 5a it's far better than 6a hanging issue	1
Awesome entry level smartphone. Face unlock works a bit slow. But okay. The processor is less power consuming. Full screen display works like charm. A five star for 1.5 day delivery by Amazon. Redmi has lot improved in the music quality section. Pretty decent overall performance. Good choice. Go for it in 6k budget before price rise again.	5
The cameras both front and rear are a huge disappointment as compared to redmi 4 and redmi 5a. I fail to understand how they could deteriorate it from previous phones. Portrait mode doesn't work properly either. I don't expect the camera of S8 or iPhone in 6000 but other phones in the same price range certainly have better to offer. Other features work well but I was really let down with the camera this time.	3
It's such an amazing budget phone. MI rocks.The display is so good.Sound is awesome.Camera works decent.It has face recognition which works well.Its design is amazing and the weight is so light. There was no lag in the phone.It works perfectly well for normal applications. Video quality is amazing.4g works well.5.45inch screen is big enough it's cool.I'm sure there are still lots of features in this 6k phone!Grab it before the introductory offer is gone, else you will end up paying 7k for same phone.	5
you install and run 2-3 apps together with a small 2gb of ram it can't handle on that ram and the phone literally hangs. Go for Redmi 5a instead. Also the processor is not that much good as compared to Qualcomm. Overall it is not that much good product from redmi	2
I purchased this for my mother who is a first time user of smart phone. MIUI is comfortable. A good budget phone by Xiaomi. It has a good battery life almost 3 days life. Pictures quality is also good at this budget price. A little disappointing Sound quality side since speakers are kept on back side of the phone.	5
I got this set on Sunday Amazon delivery is no doubt awesome phone battery do not looks 3000Mah it discharged in a day without much usage back cam is not great but front cam is good I hate Mi Ui apps it's annoying n full of ads	2
The worst thing on all mi phone is the gyroscopic sensor doesn't work,and personally after 3wk uses of mi6A , battery drain so quickly,face unlock never work properly even you can unlock the phone faster in pattern,better to invest more and go other good brand.	3
Very nice phone.... specially screen is awesome...camera is okay...sound quality is great... Overall for this prise this phone is better option.One thing Mi forgot for this phone is "IR blast"...that is missing.	5
I purchased this mobile on lightning deal. After using few days and updating that Battery life is very worst. Charge is staying for only 4-5 hrs after fully charged even if it is ideal. still i am using only one SIM. if I use dual then not able to imagine the battery life. I guess, Amazon have cheated by offering this kind of deal.	3
Phone is very slow & hanging also. Failed in mi model. Pls don't buy it. Go to another model.	1
Wow Yaar it's looking so good and performance is awesome..Over all good	5
You will Get Dual 4G You Are Looking For. Decent Camera Don't expect Much From A 6k Device.less heat Compared To Previous 5A.You Will Only Feel For The Internal memory.	4
Hi I AM TANVEER AND I AM TELL YOU MI REDMI 6A MOBILE FEATURES AND OTHER CONTAIN  THIS IS VERY USEFUL SMARTPHONE IN LOVEST PRICE . VERY GOOD QUALITY OF SOUND CAMERA SCREEN SPEAKER AS WELL AS 5A .THIS IS NEW SERIES OF MI REDMI  MI 6A.SCREEN QUALITY ETC  THANK YOU FOR YOU READ MY REWIEW	5
Phone specs looks good. But not up the mark. Sound quality is very poor. Redmi 4a was far better. Camera portrait mode works good thanks to The helio processor.	4
ProsEverything......Looking at the price point.ConsNothingIf you want a budget phone with a decent camera, this one is for you......If you are an avid gamer , sorry, not for you bro.....Has killer look and again it is smoooooth.	5
I bought it on 19Sep. All is good except an issue that even my Lift to wake is off, it is gettimg on whenever I pock my phone. This creates lot of issues when I kept my mobile at pocket or when I am in call. Screen automatically gets switched on and mute/end call gets pressed. Amy big fixes?!	2
Nice phone to have , handy and a budget smartphone. Good looking phone with nice features.	5
Great phone at this price rangeYou can't expect more from this price rangeSo just go for itAnd delivered to me 6 days before from expected date	5
Performance is better than other device.. i recommended to buy the Redmi 6A.	4
this device is totally value for money.You cant get better than this in this price segment.	5
Slow ringtone problem bcoz the speaker is in backside.  battery is very powerful. afterall the phone is better then redmi 5a	5
Yas good mobile in India Redmi 6 athis mobile phone purchase efficiency good and very budget phone Indian peoples so like that all people use  phone very good features phone condition and working screen working and almost do Indians like this phone good mobile processor xiaomi redmi 6a	4
True successor of Redmi 5A.Nice product in budget .	5
Internet is very slow, I think, its not 2 GB RAM, It is a 512 MB RAM, other features is good.	3
Good product but processer is not good as Qualcomm processer.	2
Best budget smart phone powerful performance 6A	5
Average product. Go 4 mi 6. Additional 2000 RS but you will get 3 GB RAM, dual camera and finger print sensor.	3
Received the Redmi 6A, as it is promissed in description. Another fantastic output from Xiomi India Plant. Made in India words gives astonishing experience as an Indian.	5
Good one	5
I bought 6a only 1 day ago..battery is too poor.8 hours hold it mobile in 2g network last night data off no other application on..automatically 18 percent down battery.	1
First of all delivery time take a long. display is also this range is good. processor is best not good for gamers to play pubg and GTA Sa. more lagging to play. battery backup to good..Screen ratio is superb in this smartphone and last sounds quality is medium.	4
my suggestion is only that sound speaker should be more powerful as per redmi given its previous every phones. it looks very nice and slim. processor is very fast, good battery life, good nm technology. overall it is the best phone in this price.	4
I am disappointed. I rcvd a faulty charger which is not working. This is cheating and I will NVR recommend anyone to buy this product. PLS HELP REPLACE CHARGER	1
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in weight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use.	4
Everything in this phone is good. But I got a faulty phone. The proximity sensor is not working.The Amazon service providers continuously told me lie regarding replacement and return. And now I m just to break the phone. Their lies was highly humiliating.	1
At this price it is best handsetDual 4g volte supportAntutu score about 65kOnly battery backup is little less but it is good for daily use lasted for 24 hous	4
Design is very good.dint find any heating issue after playing game for lang time.Battery life is good.Camera quality is satisfactory.	4
Good smartphone with a very slim design . Performance is good , should have provided a Snapdragon processor instead of mediatek for better performance	5
I am using this mobile since one week so I found so many lags while using youTube, camera, and also battery is draining very fast. The phone look good outside but its is very pure at performance. Please look at alternate mobiles at this price rage.	2
The mobile phone is very good looking for its price and build quality is very nice as well , all features work fine ( have not used the face unlock till now)will update review after long use	4
Not as good as Redmi 5A	3
Good Phone for the price... No finger print scanner makes it slightly off beat. However, looks good and works well too..Only issue I face, is the calls going to "hold" by itself intermittently	4
The sound quality is not upto mark when we take video. Battery and screen quality is good.It has MIUI 9 in it and have upgraded to MIUI 10 at delivery date. Everything was excellent except the delivery partner.I have to collect myself .	4
Mobile is not loaded with anything , but feel like hanging all time .. I guess UI OR software problem	1
Purchased for my father.. he loved it .. especially face unlock . ..  very light weighted... Display sounds good... But camera couldn't satisfy me... Overall it's the most economic deal at 6000	4
Good product with great price. Everything is good.	5
The sound quality is just okk, low volume speaker make hardly audible tone in crowd. Battery is decent with medium usage last for half a day. Screen is not so impressive even it doesn't seems to be 720p display.	3
Excellent Mobile, the look of it is awesome. Metallic body is strong and sturdy.The OS performance is extremely good..	3
Best budget phoneThank you Redmi	5
Sound is very lees in comparison and drains battery fast when using internet. But overall it seems to be good for rs 6000	4
Average mobile in this range but i missing finger unlock feature.	3
This phone is now compare to all products is best phone to budget.  I love this phone Face unlock super,  and now MIUI 10 version software is available now and I am using I love it	5
Price should be less than 5k or tempered glass n case should be in box	4
Its taking around 15 minutes for an app to get installed after downloading.. No issue with the internet connectivity..	2
Hanging at the intial stage without any apps downloaded and worst response from Amazon.  Proximity sensor not working	1
Battery backup not as compare to other redmi mobiles whos contain polymer battery this time li-oin battery not good	4
battery drains from 90% to 5% in 2 hours even if the phone is idle and data swiched off. the problem is with this phone only other wise MI phones have the best battery. Seems like i got a defective item	1
Over all the phone is good but better if quality is increased more like on sound,camera also heating issue is there but can be used	3
Value for money, good product. Made in India	5
I just bought this phone. only 1 week. so far performing good. But I think it cannot match my MI remi 6A which is almost the same price. Battery is dittachable, hence handy, no techy is required	4
Value for enough money,  with this price this is the number one in the market.  Please don't compare with others.  Because it's like it self. Really value for money.	4
Xiaomi products are always up to the mark, similarly this product is also good, having all features. Just fingerprint is missing, otherwise great phone.	4
i am not taken this product delivery boy asked me about opt which is sent on my numberand i want cancle this product ,waiting for great indian festival that is from 10th oct to 14 oct	2

Nice phone in this amount but the phone is very poor performance. Its work too slowly. Also Battery quality is not Better. Good face unlock system and quite faster.	3
Everything was fine but, youtube very slow and sometimes it will test your patience.	4
The speaker is not working properly.  Whenever anyone calls me I can not hear his/her voice clearly. I wanted a replacement but they denied that.	1
Average rating, battery backup is average, camera average, always performance is average	3
Superb	5
Screen is dull while using youtube video. Sound not loud as i want. Fase unlock is ok beacause it can unlock by HD pic I have tried with 22mp image.	3

hi	3
The phone is looking good for usage and hands on.Lot of pre-installed apps are there in a budget phone, not good for memory.There is dual nano SIM slot with SD card insert option, which is good.For parents or persons, who is just using the phone for speaking and WhatsApp,etc with no multi-tasking ...this is a good option in the current market of September 2018.	5
I got this product on first sale.After using it for three days here is my review.Pros-Good battery life.Nice for video call and light games.Jio is working flawless.Cons-Sound may disturb a bit as volume is low while playing songs but fine in headphones.You can go for it without second thought if you want smart phone under 6k. I am using MI product sience 2014. And satisfied. Yes  screen guard and back cover while buying phone. It will just cost 300 Rs.Hit like if you find it useful.	5
Model 8/10Screen 9/10Battery 6/10Camera 7/10ROM should be 32 GB  as 16 GB is very low, I am using external 64 GB card because 75% space is used to install apps. only 25% of internal memory is available for storage.this phone may useful for beginner.	4
My expectations were huge when i ordered the Redmi 6A. But when i got the product it was a defective one. The second slim slot was not accepting SIM. I Initiated the return and it was very fast, good service by amazon. But still quality checks of products should be done accurately to avoid such issues.	1
YouTube and other videos are very dull... It's not worth 6000/-.	2
Wow what a phone redmi 6A is...  Very nice display,  light weight single hand use awesome feeling in hand, great battery backup thanks to 12 nm technology,  nice processor.  Good camera.  AI face unlock Only xiaomi can make incredible phone like this... I have used lot of phones till date but this phone is different, beautiful, easy to use, good built quality, this phone is smooth like butter. Thanks Xiaomi for this great device at a very low price.	5
Nice Budget phone.Screen quality - HD+Storage - Not up to mark, can expect so better to use SD cards.Dedicated SD card slot is good.Camera is as usual as other redmi phone have.This phone is not for those who like to play game in mobile.Overall 7 out of 10	3
Look beautiful	4
Nice phone under 6000rs	5
Its slightly slow,2gb ram is not sufficient.you get only 8gb out of 16 gb.sound quality is not good.Display is decent because it is not fhd only hd+.Can't say about battery backup, i will update later.5k is enough for this phone, Redmi is looting 1k/ phone because of it's brand value in India.Look is not so much attractive.You can get more better phone in this price range.	2
Don't waste your money, the processor is supper slow and will take ages to load.Waste of Money!!! Nice experiment in budgeted category by REDMI; however, it has broken the trust I had :(	1
Redmi 6a comes with classy look & light in wiight. Camera quality is moderate, comes with lot of installed apps which result 8.44gb vacant space. This mobile is not for those who use social media or heavy usage app bcz it start hanging at very early use. Acc to me..redmi 5a is much better than 6a.	3
Called to return this device but the only replace it but I can't get a refund.Don't buy this phone if you need decent speed.This phone is too slow and camera quality is so cheap for 6000.3500 would justify the money.	1
Got it in first sale. Definitely a worthy upgrade of Redmi 5A. Looks way modern than its predecessor. Compact, light weight, beautiful. The display is gorgeous, processing speed is higher than 5A.The camera is decent. Most important thing about this phone is you are getting all things in a very low budget. Those who are looking for a decent 4G phone, you can't get better than this. 3GB ram variant would be much needed.	5
I like so much	5
Awesome phone in  6000pros1 large screen and good display2 face unlock3 good processor4 no lag5 google assistant is working fine6 Dual 4g7 Light weightcons1 camera is not that good as i expected as i also have samsung on 5 and the focus of on5 camera is far better than 6Ait is difficult to focus on object like flowers etc,because of focus image becomes blurry2 sometimes faceunlock may not workoverall its good phone in this budget	4
Sound is not that much good	3
Gud phne...only issue is internl memomry(8gb avialable ny fr use in 16gb phne) nd 2gb ram...	5
I recieved the mobile after 5days. The mediatek processor is very slow while opening the apps it takes ages to open while battery is disgusting while compring 6a to 5a is far better. 5a contains sd425 is far better while opening the youtube it takes time to open while at th booting it takes to restart the phone. It is worst exprience with phone.	1
I was using redmi 5a which is really great .I have purchased it because i want dual volte at lower price but at this time redmi disappointed me because it has no fingerprint again and also IR BLASTER missing which is in redmi 5a .helio p22 is not so good as i tried to run pubgm in low graphics settings but it still hangs and i m not satisfied with camera quality as it's exposure is not good compared to redmi 5a otherwise it is same as redmi 5a .i have purchased it only due to dual volte	3
Advantages-Compact size3 slote (2sim volte + micro sd)Great photographyLow light condition is okVery bright flash lightFast Face lockLoud SoundLot of Sensors (double tap,hold and more gesture)Disadvantages-Only 2 gb ramLots of extra apps pre install	5
Excellent just loved it...	5
Redmi 6a phone is very good in this price and face unlock is best feature in this mobile.	5
At this price ,redmi done awesome job 13 MP rear camera3000 mAh battery13.8 cm HD+ Display2GB RAM16 GB ROMnano sim card + nano sim card +expandable micro SD card slot (both 4g/volte )Micro USB chargerUser guide manualSim card eject pin(No earphone)	5
The best smartphone under 6000 rupees budget anyone can buy. Although internal space is a bit low but you can pop in an SD card also, so overall the phone feels lightweight and comfortable to hold. I would recommend this under 6K budget with decent specs and looks.	5
Mi always rocks With New launch of model. We just received this product Checked Config and compared with 5a its good. We selected 2 Day delivery and Received Today morning 10 Am. Amazon is so fast now days.	5
At this price range this is best smartphone option available. When we compare it with 5A , 6A has bigger screen, face unlockand better display quality. While 6A has 2Ghz quadcore Mediatek Helio A22 processor, 5A has 1.4 Ghz quadcore snapdragon 425 processor , that means 6A has latest processor, but I have seen some YT videos stating that 5A has better performance than 6A. Best feature of this device I liked is it has active 4G on both SIM cards. Face id takes little time to unlock phone but its fine at this price range. Must buy. You won't get any other phone at this price range with these feature.	4
Very good mi 6A mobile phones very low price only 5999 2gb 16gb 5.45 display hd+ love you Amazon and mi	5
Nice phone at this price..	5
I m using this mobile since 5 days...We can see the everything separately...Battery: battery backup is too good as mi phones are well known for thisCamera: camera seems perfect as per the price of this phoneProcessor:mediatek A22 processor is not that good as Qualcomm Snapdragon processor that is used in redmi 5A...but it's fine...you won't see any laggingRAM:you will get only 700-800mb to use because there is total of 2gb ram available...you can't expect smooth high graphics gaming environment...best for other uses	5
mind blow super	5
One day delivery was awesome. Storage available for usage is only around 8gb. Need to buy memory card. Price should be between 5 and 5.5k only. Not worth 6k. Feedback about battery and performance I will update after usage only.	3
Received on 26th September-18, started function on 28th after placing new nano SIM, but it's suddenly stopped working from 7th morning. Trying to contact local MI service centre but it closed.	5
The phone is looking good for usage and hands on.Lot of pre-installed apps are there in a budget phone, not good for memory.There is dual nano SIM slot with SD card insert option, which is good.For parents or persons, who is just using the phone for speaking and WhatsApp,etc with no multi-tasking ...this is a good option in the current market of September 2018.	5
Phone is good but video quality is not good ..when you see  YouTube ,Facebook video is not perfect play ..poor quality seen	3
Pro:-A big screen.Cons:-1.Bad sound quality.2.Hangs while using YouTube.3.Hangs using apps simultaneously.4.Cameras 13MP/5MP works mysteriously low as compared to other phones of same specs.5. The processor sucks.6. You only get 8GB storage.The phone shouldn't have costed more than 5000.Seems xaomi will end up very soon.	2
Dont run behind expensive Nokia one plus moto Vivo. They are just making fool to customer. Think jan Nokia 6 launch Rs. 18000 then after 3 month Nokia 6.1 launch Rs. 19000 then just after 3 month Nokia 6.1 plus launch 16000.  It means company overprices its every launch. Latest model is cheaper then earlier with added feature how it is possible.So I request all smartphone buyers do not buy smartphone higher then 10000.	5
NyC LoOkINg NyC Features	5
Overall good quality, the camera is nice, the voice over call is cool, AI unlock works most of the time, Speaker is not that satisfactory, but what else you need at such price.. I aint a gamer,, so this is good for me... Also,, space issue is there,, available memory is less....consider buying a memory card....	5
Superb product with Super Price...Redmi 6AI am also Redmi Note5pro UserRedmi is always Number 1No words to say about my happiness....Love you Soo much Xiaomi...	5
Amazing quality ...Redmi done a good job...	5
Mobile is so good. Every thing is nice. Value of money.	5
best phone in this budget, bought for my Mom, she is happy with it, big screen with small form factor.good if not best camera, good sound quality from audio jack.	4
My device face enroll option is not show	1
I love it.	5
The mobile is perfect based on battery, camera, screen resolution as well as dedicated card slot and dual 4G. Just no IR blaster present, so no remote, that's the only flaw.	5
Phone was great and it is bigger than Redmi 5a and camera quality was also good but packing was so not good but other was good ? It is 16gb internal and2gb ram ?	5
Nice	1
in this budget you are getting best mobile phone having face lock same feature as my MI MAX 2 having little functions like MI Remote is missing in this camera is good, overall perfect phone in this price	5
Awesome phone under 7k*Good camera*Good screen*Good sound clarity*Good battery	4
This phone is just amazing I sugest to buy it in this budget it is best phone under 6K	5
Front and back camera is good.But screen resolution is not good.	4
Guys its a budget phone,never expect more from it,for regular and normal use its better in the market in this price range.Seems good after few days usage..Battery back up ok for 1.5days.Screen resolution not fhd but ok...good for eye.Processor not for gamers.You need to buy a memory card for it.Both Camera good for this price.Sound not so loud but clear.U can delete pre-installed unnecessary apps to clear the ram and make the phone fast.Dual nano sim 4G support and 256GB expandable memory feature is best Point of this phone.For budget phone users go for it....	4
am used this brand from 3 years ago but this handset is totally worthless product	1
awesome phone.. in 6k.. black look is great..	5
got the phone at 9am, Looks good in hand, But disappointed only 7.83 GB Available out of 16 GB Which is very less, face unlock works Good, tried with photo not unlocked, But i took my photo in my friend's vivo 20mp camera and tried unlocked many times, this is very sad i am using PIN now, display under  sunlight OK with full brightness, Camera pictures good, bot front and rear, price should be 5000, not 6000 Redmi made name and looting now. will update about battery and performance after two days,	3
Best budget phone in this price	5
I will not demand anything more for just Rs.6000. Fully Satisfied.	5

One day delivery was awesome. Got the phone 11.45 . Phone is very good, looks so nice camera ok. But storage 8GB out of 16 GB, its very disappointing, otherwise redmi is a top selling brand 	4

Bhai sound quality down & battery backup is very low this phone is bad response for me & I suggest to you don't buy this phone	1
Youtube app video dont play a good picture quality...rest all well in this price range	3
Bought this on the very 1st sale and i am impressed.Keeping in mind the price i would say that the mobile is amazing.U get dual sim 4g and a memory card slot.Basic apps run well on the 2gb ram. Camera is decent as well. And the display is good enough. And the face unlock works(it is a bit slow although).The only drawbacks are:No fingerprint sensor and ir blaster.The device volume could have been a bit higher.Overall ghe the best mobile for 6k	5
Not a great phone but cannot expect more than anything for this price. Poor camera quality and battery life is also not good. We cannot take the pics at night and this will work at day time some extent. Sound quality is not bad but not up to the marak. Screen resolution is not good.If someone is looking for Android phone for calling purpose go for it. For other purpose like gaming and watching videos and browsing choose other good RAM phone.Display-6/10Design-6/10Camera-5/10Sound-6/10Battery-4/10Price -8/10	3
This smartphone has a hardware issue. It's second sim slot is not working. I am sure that I  have only got the defective product or not. I opted for replacement. I do not expect a smartphone manufacturer such as Xiaomi which has poor quality checkup standards. I am hoping to get working smart after replacement.	1
Fantastic product in terms of body, looks, battery etc. The part which misses the rating is the buggy software which brings the hardware to life. Its the security bug which locks repeatedly though you enter correct pin or pattern; especially more observed when dual space is enabled. Mi website also lists the issue in so many threads. Go for a Google search of "Phone Has been locked, Try Again in 119 minutes" and verify yourself. Its all about the bug in several of the mi product, and personally faced many times. Imagine you have to call a Uber  or Ola cab to catch a flight and you get the message. Other issue is heating, which is prominent in hot weather. Be careful if you are in Delhi or Gujarat during summer.  Otherwise phone is good in this budget.	2
The phone is too slow. Please don't go for this. Despite of having 2GB RAM, Phone lags too much.And you will get unnecessary ads by Xiaomi. Which gets really annoying sometimes.	1
Cheap and best compare to all other brand products....	5
Bought this phone for my dad, and he uses it for just Whatsap and Youtube. Even though battery is just 3000mah, phone can be used for the entire day with a single charge. Only con is its plastic body. Other than that, this is a good buy for avg users in this price range.	5
Slightly lagging with normal use Xaiomi worst decision to go for Helio A22 better go with redmi 6 with some more penny...deserve 10 of 6 to this phone	4
Picture quality is not so good. You will get to know this when u watch a YouTube vedio even in 360p .Regarding sound I would say average . You will get to know this when u play a song in loudspeaker.Battery is above average.	5
Really budget smartphone.....	5

Hi Guys today i am writing a review about Redmi 6A. This is an entry-level smartphone that got the basics right.First of all best thing is that i got that phone in first sale that is osm. I ordered that for my dad. i am using redmi note 5 pro which is amazing. i got the base version with 2GB RAM and 16GB storage for Rs 5,999 in black colour.Firstly let me explain the specification of the Redmi 6A:- It comes with dual sim also that it has extra slot for memory card too, which is amazing mostly all others phones comes with hybrid those are just comes with two slot where u can add two sim or one sim and one memory card , So this is best option in this phone.- That comes with oreo update (8.1) that is great also the mi user interface update is MIUI 9.0. They promised the MIUI 10 update soon.- There is 13MP Back camera and 5MP Front facing son.- It comes with 5.4 inches screen with an aspect ratio of 18:9- I purchase the model 2GB Ram and 16GB Internal memory. we can extend the memory to 256GB with microSD card- That comes with Quad-core 2.0 GHz.- The Battery is 3000 mah that is non-removableIn a Box:In a box i get Redmi 6A phone, Adapter and One Usb Cable. There is little disadvantage to buy that redmi phone is that they didnt give the headphones with the mobile that is major drawbacks but the features they are providing in this price range is best.So today i just received the phone and that is just unboxing. so i will update my review as per my eperience with this phone after one month and update so on.In the first phase and first day this is my first experience of this phone Redmi-6A, soon i will update my review as per my experience.So, Overall my experience of today this phone is that it has a pretty good deal if you searching for better smartphone with low price then i must say that this is best deal as per my opinion right now.	4
Never expected this from Xiaomi. I have Redmi 2 Prime which is far better than this phone. Redmi 6A is very very slow, video quality not good, camera not good, keyboard appear very slow when finding a contact to call, lot of ghosting when moving the camera in the room for focus. I just used it for half a day and repacked it and put it in shelf. Again switched back to my Moto G4 play. Not sure if Amazon take the return but I will try to return it. Don't buy this phone. My sincere advice.Update: I was able to return my phone. They said they can't return money but will send a replacement. And then again said since they don't have stock so returned the amount itself.	1
Received the phone today.Packing was good.Phone is good.Considering the budget it's a nice phone with excellent features.It won't disappoint you but keep in mind that it's a budget smart phone.Face unlocking works fine.fingerprint unlock is a missing factor which must be noticed.For someone looking for a base model smartphone it's a good option.As we all know redmi won't disappoint us.I think the face unlock was needless in this one and fingerprint would have been the better option.Anyways it's a value for money model.	4
Even though it is a brand new phone it started showing lag and keeps hanging while using... Will not recommend buying it....	1
Ordered in a minute when deal was opened. Within 3 minutes all sold out. But luckily I got one.On the features of the mobile its really out of the level. Never expected such a featuristic mobile for such price.Been using iPhone as well. Most of the features available in iPhone are available in this mobile also.Finally really worth for money. Do buy only from Cloud Tail.Certified Seller 	5
EVERYTHING  IS GOOD But disappointed only 7.83 GB Available out of 16 GB Which is very less, face unlock works Well, tried with photo not unlocked.	4

The phone which I purchased through amazon is a worst, I cannot trust amazon anymore, I purchased Redmi 6A on 12th of Nov. I own the phone tried using it, since its a dual sim, I inserted my two sim, n tried using,the second sim was not detectable, I took out again n tried inserting again,the same thing was showing on, I took the new phone to a mobile shop to show it, den the shopkeeper said the motherboard is not good, so funny the new phone which I purchased was from amazon redmi 6A,is not a good phone, I have kept the phone to change the mother board..worst experience ever...	1
Phone is worth. Only battery mh is i think low. Now not a problem in future Batery one days full use or not i don't know	4

One of the best phones in between these months. Battery life is very good, sound quality is perfect and picture quality is too good. Also it is not heating ;that's the best thing I liked a lot.Totally a perfect phone in a suitable budget for Indian people.In a single word for saying about this phone is COMPLETE PERFECT.The bill sent by  Amazon or the seller is not very good quality so that in a damaging situation within warranty period may create difficulty. This is the one thing that I haven't get any answer yet.For this reason I don't give full rating.I am giving two opinions about the phone & the warranty or payment bill of this product from my own experience. Choice is Yours.	4

Love the phone. Everything on it works as expected.  I've been using this phone for about 1 weeks, and so far I'm loving it. Here's me breakdown:The quality, fit and finish are amazing. No one believes this is low priced phone.Battery: exceptional battery life, the best in any smartphone I've had so far.Build/design: one of the best smartphone designs and build quality I've used, even compared to much more expensive models.Camera: not as good as my Honor 7C, but still takes good enough pictures that it's not really a problem for me.Really littil bit difficult to find fault with this phone, especially for the price even I don't like the audio quality. overall Best Product. Durable solid feel, very responsive and works great overall.	4

During the call without headset, the display is not getting off so that, it resulting to adding another call and sometime hold the current calls without knowledge.While speaking the display should off to avoid such issues where proximity sensor is not functioning in the mobile, when check with customer care they are asking to format all the data's and handover the mobile to them for software update..., very much disappointed.., why cant we should have update directly from MI	1

Camera is very good..I m already using other mobile phones of redmi...all of them..and this one also have a good battery and best part is...redmi kbhi hang nii krta...so it is best at this price....n ya ho log 2 gb ram ko km smjh kr nahi lena chahte...plzz redmi me 2gb is more than enough...so plz go for it...i will also thank amazon..for fast delivery and very good packaging...love you amazon	5
Best product at this price...	5
pros :1. it's stand by time is amazing2. screen quality is good although not clearly visible in direct sunlight3. dual 4g works like a charm4. back camera is decent, good for the price5. it has dedicated micro SD card slot so memory is not a problemcons :1. screen on time is bad redmi y2 also has a 3000 mah battery but it's battery life is far better than this2. front camera is not good in low light3. the speaker is terrible. it's on the back and it's not very loud so many times I missed calls.4. I don't know if xiaomi will deliver regular security updatesVerdictIt's definitely a good phone for it's price also i just saw it's price increased 600 rupees so i would say if battery life is your highest priority and you can spend extra 1400 go for the realme c1.

I had recently purchased MI 6A phone. But after 3 days of the purchase the phone started giving issues on the call quality. While the call is going on suddenly there is a drop of the voice where either side cannot hear each other. I did not expect this with MI phones as previous versions have been quite stable.This is unfortunate that the date of return is gone and now only the repair center will be doing the rest by taking another 15 days to fix the same.	1

What one could expect for a 6k price . If someone wants a phone within 6k segment this is the best. Go for it but do not expect much.	4
Its best for moderate users. Perfect in budget and much better performance at this price of 5999. It has nice design and looks nice.  It is light weight, slim and battery easily lasts for one day. Camera quality is not best but it's good and give clear shots. Getting dual 4g at this price is awesome thing. Screen display is best. Only thing I found bad was a little bit lagging while using heavy apps or games otherwise best option for normal users who don't use heavy apps or games (like pubg. Its lags a little even with minimum pixels). On looking the price tags it's best at 6k price range.	4
I like likethis price segment phone at the brand. But this time not for sure is this value for money.	4

Mi 6a is a typical mi phone. It looks like other mi phones.It has face unlock feature which make it special,face unlock is good(if you haven't used face unlock phone yet otherwise it's satisfactory).If your budget is under 6k then this phone is nice(you can't expect some hi fii phone under 6k).Battery is also good.Camera is up to the mark.It is much nice than my expectation	5

Overall the phone is worth for the price but there are two annoying issues I'm already facing.Auto Brightness is very annoying as it constantly keeps changing and easily noticeable.  It should be seamless.Speaker quality is on the cheaper side and feels muddy and the peak volume is also low.I'll keep updating further as I use 	4

i got what i expected no over heating , Getting 36 hours battery back up with usage of you tube, news, voice sometimes, and without whats app.  Out of 2GB, 950 MB left for free which is sufficient for normal users. 8GB ROM free. Loaded apps are MS Office apps, all google, Mi apps security, cleaner, drop, video, store, community, Other apps, amazon, facebook, phonepe, netflix, dailyhunt, share chat, opera. Updates to MUIU 10, Charging takes 3 hrs.Pros. Two sides mic, Very good touch, Good camara's, No lag, Separate slot for Mem card.Cons: No gorilla glass, No front flash but blur effect on back view. Ring is avg loud. Indoors good, but outdoors we should concentrate.	5

This product is worth spending the money for...I have recommended 2 of my Friends to buy this phone... had amazing experience	5
Camera is descent Very good mobile phone in 6000 price range there are also other phone in this range but guys go for this one trust me MI mobile are very good ...they are giving overall package means other phone either they will give good quality camera ,battery, design etc  for e.g. oppo and Vivo mobile there camera are good but overall I dont like they are putting hell lot of money on advertisements and not on product ...but if you go for mi they are near to perfection in giving value for money... I really trust this brand according to me they are new SAMSUNG  the way they we used to trust this brand for smart phone e.g. galaxy y series but now they are lagging behindThis what I feel first phone which I order was mi 4i for my sister which she used almost three years without any issues then boom my whole family mi productMi 4i , Redmi 3s, note 3,note 4, Redmi 4, Redmi y2,Redmi 5a ,Redmi 6a trust me till now none of mi product has disappointed us ....Redmi 6a is very decent phone for parentsIf you found my review helpfulPlease give helpful vote	4

The product is very good but the battery life and the processor is very poor if you have a low budget and you want to buy something very normal or good thing so this is so this product is very perfect for that requirement the camera quality is awesome but the vibration is not very good and the xiaomi keyboard is a very bad whenever I use Google keyboard Sonic keyboard replace it on Google so that's a bad thing about I see in this phone and yesterday I buy this phone and the day after tomorrow the phone is not working properly is this display is not working well so finally I restart and reboot and wipe all the data from this phone and then its fun working properly and charger cable is very the data cable is very low very small	3

Got the black 6A(2gb/16gb) today thru amazon. First impression : Looks: lovely. MIUI s/w: impressive. Camera quality: superb. Sound: not bad. Sleek & light. MI offers this phone at a price which is probably unthinkable to its competetors. Glad to have chosen MI Redmi 6A.	4

Great phone at this price truly	5
Redmi 6a is good product. But 2gb ram is less for smooth functioning. Picture and sound quality is best but battery is average.  It's only 6-7 hours battery life if you charge fully then. You get MIUI 10 in redmi 6a. In camera you got portrait mode for selfies. Rear camera quality is too good. But it's work on mediatek this is it's minus point. Screen 5.5 inches. All over I like this phone.	4

worst product from MI	1
Product is as expected to be. BTW my first order was cancelled claiming it was damaged and returned to the seller from my city without reaching to me and without confirmation. Refund process went normal. This time it got delivered just next day of placing the order. Handset is worth in this price for average use. Don't expect high end gaming. Best as a gift for parents if they are still using JAVA phone. I also bought this for my parents. Satisfied.	4

After 4 days use I discovered that the battery performance is poor and voice quality is not so good. Also mi logo at back case was faded. Requested amazon for exchange, they sent a technician for inspection and surprisingly he accepted its a faulty mobile and amazon promised refund of money after pickup. Amazon service prompt but mobile is poor.	1

Nyc mobile	5
Xiaomi has completely messed up the redmi 6 series with mediatek chipsets.I am a big fan of xiaomi and used to recommend xiaomi phones for all right from redmi note 3 times but Xiaomi isn't good these days. Mediatek chipset seems better only on paper, in real world performance even 1.5 yr old redmi 4A can easily beat it.Though rear camera quality has improved , selfie camera performance is disappointing.Battery life is no way close to the Redmi 4A or 5A. And the ram management,real world performance feels completely worst .Worst xiaomi phone ever.Now the under 7k market is filled with better devices like powerful Realme c1 , feature rich lenovo A5 and snappy Asus max lite so be wise to choose a good phone.Even redmi 5A is far better choice than this.Wish things get improved with Miui updates.	3
Sound is worst. You can't understand whether your phone is s ringing or not at max volume also. Ring volume is worst	1

Camera is not Good it doesn't have image stabilizer.	4
Honestly speaking, this was my first Xiaomi device that I bought from Amazon. And I'm not disappointed at all. The battery life is good, the screen quality is good and the sound quality is good as well. The only problem is that the speaker is backfacing, so if the phone is kept with screen upwards, then any sound, specially call ringtone, won't be heard at all. Even at the highest volume. The phone is good at this price. Decent performance. The camera is good as well. For a person who is looking for a first smartphone, go for it. But beware of bloatware. It might annoy you.Thank You.	4

I bought this phone for my mom but I thought I should test it as my primary device for few days. After few days of usage here are first impressions of this budget phone: Build Quality (8/10): It has a solid plastic build. It has rear curves slightly towards the edges which gives good grip on phone so don't worry about slipping phone from your hand. Camera (9/10): 13 MP rear camera takes decent shots in daylight. The front camera is 5 MP with portrait mode feature which works on AI which does fairly good job. So selfie camera in general takes decent photos with beauty mode. Display(8.5/10) : It has 5.4 inches hd LCD display with 18:9 aspect ratio which makes less bezels. Viewing angles are not that good but acceptable for two peoples. It performs average in sunlight keeping in mind its price. Performance(7/10): This phone comes with Helio A22 chipset with 2 GB ram. Phone comes with so many pre loaded apps which you can disable. This phone sucks in multitasking. You can play small games on it. Xiaomi will improve it's performance with MIUI 10 update.(MIUI 10 Beta is already out and works fantastic) Battery(9/10): It has decent 3000 mAh battery which gives you whole day power for moderate usage.Other specifications which are impressive at this price:1. AI face unlock2. Dual VOLTE3. Dual sim slot + memory card slotCons:No fingerprint scanner  Overall rating : 8.5/10  With such a low price tag it is best mobile in the market. You can definitely buy it. Recommended.  If you find this helpful, don't forget to press helpful button.	4

The phone is very nice and the build quality is also good and it has a nice display and a good speaker in this price range in performance wise the phone is good for normal users like surfing and it is good for casual gaming but comes to heavy games like pubg etc the phone sucks the phone is not good for gaming it really sucks go for real me c1 adding 1000 buck don't buy it for the user's who do heavy games in their phone but the other wise for common users it is a good phone no lags in surfing in internet etc it is really a good choice for common people BUT IF YOU ARE GAMER DONT BUY IT REALLY SUCKS !!! go for real me C1 it's will give u decent performance in this price range	3
Not at all happy.  Poor sound quality.  When phone rings back cover Virabets.  My redmi 2 was 100 times better than this.	2

This product is very good in this prizeThanks for mi and Amazon	4
Superb!!!!Good built, phone feels solid in hand. Battery easily lasts more than 24hrs under moderate usage including gaming.I love the camera with full manual control, front portrait, advance beauty mode etc.Tap to focus is fast, so is the auto focus in vedeo mode. HRD takes milli seconds to capture. Huge improvement in camera department.It can hold two sims with micro sd card at a time since it has dedicated triple slot. Supports dual 4g.Sadly there is no finger sensor, face unlock is present and is software based.	4
Awesome Product at this price range. It has very good quality of camera and very good battery life. I use this product past 4 days and I fully satisfied.	5

Was giving a thought on buying the real me c1, but passed it on since the OS in real me sucks big time as its mostly unpolished. So this was the 2nd best option after that.Pros:Good Battery life.Dual 4g support.Design wise its easy to operate, poly carbonated body ensures the durability but placement of speakers could have been at the bottom.User interface, though noticed some hiccups, nothing an update can't solve.A better Chip than SD425.Light weight.Display is good for the pricing.Cons:Removal of the IR blaster.Average Camera, though didn't have high hopes for it as per the pricing.Additional apps or bloatware, if you know how to deal with them, it shouldn't be the case.	4

Battery life	5
Overall a perfect smartphone in this budget. Camera is the biggest positive in the phone. Thought it doesn't have dual camera the quality vof picture is amazing. Selfie camera is also great and has portrait mode which works amazing.2 GB ram is sufficient in this segment though you would feel 16 GB (8.4 GB usable) is less storage space.Built quality is good. Screen quality is also nice and can play HD videos.Overall the best phone in this range.	5
phone hang....dont buy	1
Bought this device for my younger brother, he seems very happy with it. I used it for a day myself and the performance is excellent for the price range. Games like pubg can also run easily on this device (on low graphics).	5

Product is good but delivery boy behavior was very bad. It is very unfortunate  that maximum delivery boy of Amzon could behave properly with the customers	4
I didnt get ear phones	1
I bought this phone on Sep 19th, got it on 20th.Phone is a good one at this price point. No doubt in that. There are few things Amazon can do to better @.1. Make all colour options available.2. As part of the Great Indian Sale free screen replacement/insurance is provided. It would be better if the same is provided for all other customers who had bought the same phone within the last month period. It feels like I was deprived of the offer just because I bought the phone earlier, though at the same cost.Could not think of better place to mention this than this review.	4
Nice phone in this price range.i think battery should be 4000mah.	4

Super mobile is 6a, good feature	5
For the price tag it's a great buy. This is indeed a good smartphone. A phone for the parents.Build quality is awesome. MIUI 10 packs tons of features, and looks very modern. The battery backup on this device is also quite decent.Cons---This phone does not come with a fingerprint scanner. Its processor isn't that powerful and results in underwhelming performance.	5

Good phone 6k face camera very bad quality	4
First time disappointed with redmi. NOT SURE WHY THEY GO LIKE SAMSUNG, the processor is a gimmik  Redmi used to create a wow effect in budget phones, but this time its just you get what you pay. Extend your budget and go for something good. The phone is utter slow, color reproduction is not upto mark. Youtube videos are pathetic. Redmi 4A was even better.	3
Bought it for my mom. The screen is okay for the price. Face unlock is great. A bit on the slower side. Overall an acceptable phone for 6k. Nothing mind blowing about this phone.	4
Music could have been better.. In the sense that at the bottom the speakers should have been there... Otherwise good	3
