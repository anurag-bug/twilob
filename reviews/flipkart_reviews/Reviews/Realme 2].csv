Classy product I request people not to post low ratings because u r unable to find the Sim ejector tool rather u can refer YouTube videos for this..no need to give this device rating 1. The screen is big..Notch display really looks premium.. Fingerprint sensor is quite good so also the face unlocking is. The phone is light weight too Now coming to the CAMERA I was using VIVO V5 plus (all know that has a very good camera quality) ..I exchanged it to buy this mobile.. so if I am satisfied with Realme 2 camera...  	5

Must buy! I have been using this smartphone for last 10 days and here is my thoughts about it -  Camera - Dual camera at this price is very tough and this camera performs really good. Bokeh effect is also good and edge detection is spot on. I am loving the camera on this and it pushes me to take photos all the time. I also like selfies a lot and this one also got some stickers which looks super cool. Specially after the recent upgrade, camera is performing more than expected. Display is amazing. I al...  	5
Awesome Asm phone   	5
Mind-blowing purchase Best Phone, light weight, better camera and fast processor, long lasting battery  	5
Classy product I bought this phone is first sale with HDFC offer and it turned out to be a good deal. The notch screen and diamond back design is very beautiful. The phone feels premium. The camera is a dual camera and it clicks pretty good pictures. The selfies are very clear and worthy for social media. Photos taken with back camera are crisp and clear with proper details and no noise. I even tried taking casual videos and they were too very nicely recorded. I really like the bokeh effect for good photos....  	5

Terrific Display is very bright and impressive camera quality is upper average otherwise mobile is superb. Under 10000 it is the best smartphone looking very classy and easy to hold your hand And best parts is it delivered under 24 hour  	5
Best in the market! 1. Display is actually very good but doesn't feel bulky whlie taking in hand. Display colour is good but in such a large display full hd resolution would be better. 2. Battery backup is also very good and lasts till full day. while the phone have 4230 mah battery but phone is pretty light weight. 3. Camera performance in day light does very good job. But in low lighting conditions camera struggles while taking pictures from both cameras. A selfie flash should give much good results in low l...  	5

Must buy! Excellent device under such an amazing and satisfying price segment. it has many good factors. and many people criticized the phone's Sd 450 processor but,they were wrong. after about using it around 1 week, I am reviewing about it. 1) phone looks stunning,screen quality is good enough. just, needed to opt out full brightness in outdoors. 2) battery is fully great.  even don't drains usually within 1 and a half day while heavy usage. 3) although it comes with huge battery it doesn't feels bul...  	5
Really Nice It's a Budget Smartphone for those people who didn't have much Money to buy 15K Smartphones.. For my Perspective in this Range Real me2 is Best option for you.. CAMRA - 4/5      I give it 4 because of Front Selfi Camra.. it's just Amazing better than Redmi Y2..But there is some problem in Real camera.. It's capture images not very Sharply..even in potrait Images we feel something Dullness and Unclearity.. BATTERY - 4/5       If you have 100% Battery than you easily use it for 1.5 Days...Fo...  	4

Terrific purchase My review on day 1: This is an awesome device from real me. i never thought a phone priced at 9k and a new brand to be this good.  Pros :- 1. Beautiful Screen with Notch  2. Overall Look and feel is good 3. Face unlock works like a charm in normal light to mediocre light but struggles in complete darkness 4. Camera's are good. nothing to complain 5. It's Fast The only con i noticed is the color os. I didn't like it personally. At 9k, it is the most glamorous phone !  	5

Value-for-money Realme 2 is a good downgrade but should be fixed by software updates.   Please give ample software updates to issue the  mentioned performances like . 1 . Low resolution Dual Camera  2. . Lack of preinstalled application 3. 1080 playback via youtube. 4. lagging while playing PUB G . 5. Headphone sound enhancement should be improved by software updates. I hope realme fix these issues soon . Rest are ok. Its durable with gorrilaglass. Nice product .   	4

Mind-blowing purchase first of all thanks to realme 2 for making such an awesome phone. I sold my well working Redmi 4 for just 4000 to buy this mobile. From the moment I watched the unboxing video of this mobile on Technical Guruji's channel I just wanted to buy it. Now I have it and that's all.  The battery backup actually is great. I can play Pubg for 2-3 hours  and still have 50% battery left. The cameras are perfect. The fingerprint unlock is a little bit slow but that's acceptable as the face unlock is inst...  	5

Best in the market! If you keep on reading reviews and judge , you will never be satisfied. Hats off to Realme for offering the product with key rich features @ unbelievable price. Just go for it guys.... Note : In today's trend , there a new model launched every week by one or the other brand and no one uses the phone forever. Buy it until it is worth using and  then upgrade. Keep it simple !!!  	5

Touch is not ok. I have used for 5 days before writing a short review of this mobile.  1) First of all i feel that touch is not good when i have tested with multi touch app it shows wrong touch inputs.  2) If you are playing too much game on your mobile then i must say this is not gaming phone, so heavy gamer please avoid this mobile. 3) Battery and display is good. Last from software point of view that you didn't get original or full coloros, many of the features are cut down for the realme 2.  4) Note: I ha...  	3
