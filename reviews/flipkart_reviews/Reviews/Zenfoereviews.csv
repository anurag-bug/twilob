As expected...!! Actually I have to give it 4.5 stars. First of all the delivery by Flipkart was amazing fast, within 48 hours I received my parcel. Talking about the packaging, it was fine but not up to the mark. Now talking about the box contents, the box include smart phone wrapped in plastic also including some paperwork a charger brick including a USB to micro USB cable. Also the box has an unexpected utility which is known as sound box according to Asus.                -Now talking about the handset, th...  	4

Terrific grey looks better than black  	5
Terrific don't stuck in negative reviews..just go for it. the major issues which all are talking fingerprint and cameras. fingerprint sensors are improving much by updates..hope they will fix it soon. Both cameras of the phone are nice..the problem is with the app..that was waste..if we are installing Google cameras then you can feel the difference (major issue for this is this can done only through rooting). front cam is improving..but now also I'm not satisfied..but future updates will may improve i...  	5

Great product Best phone under the budget!! Superb battery, good camera and crisp display!!!  	5
Would recommend this if you don't bother much about camera I'd really recommend one to buy this phone. But do have a look at few factors. * Camera : 4/5   There is some problem with the quality of photos taken with the front camera. It doesn't seem like 8 MP camera. But I am sure ASUS will improve it through OTA updates.  Coming to rear camera it's performance is pretty good. It's on par with Redmi note 5 pro  (except during low light condition) * Performance : 5/5 No words... It's just amazing. We get to see the absolute amazing performance of the...  	5

Good quality product Looks and display is very good. battery is decent. expected more backup as I am just a normal user(no gaming) but it was down to 60% in general browsing in 4g.  download and browsing speed is fast. camera is not good for the given pixel. hope they improve camera performance in future updates. I am switching from Windows to Android. couldn't find any import or export function for copying contacts from my old phone.  it fell short of my expectations. After OTA  update battery is working proper...  	4

Great product 1st review after one full day usage: Came with battery 60%, was dropping very fast. Dropped till 30 in 2hrs of heavy usage. Slight heating noticed. Got FOTA update. Switched off at 25% charged till full, took 1hr 40mins with the bundled charger. 3pm yesterday. Since then using bit more than normal usage and current battery state is 30% after almost 1 full day.

Best in the market! Great come back by ASUS! Just read this once and i am sure your doubts will be cleared. The Pros as already mentioned in detailed summary in specifications.  So, directly coming what are the drawbacks yet present in this phone. The only cons present in this phone yet that the sharpness as seen in 'Redmi Note 5 Pro' is missing in Zenfone Max Pro M1 in the pictures that shoot from front camera (however, the same will be issued soon by OTA updates). Call recording, Ultra Power Saving Mode, Mu...  	5
Wonderful awesome display and battery back up with descent cameras.OTA update gave a change.... it is a best alternative for redmi note 5 pro.iam using note 5 pro too but Asus rear camera is better than note 5 pro and front cam is good in note 5 pro .Display and battery are the  highlight. gesture control is gud. thank u Flipkart and asus.  	5
Excellent love you asus  	5

Great product Excellent performance but front camera is not good  	5
Killer of Redmi Note 5 pro Best phone under  under 12000 K, I am sure this phone will overcome Redmi note 5 pro if Asus make open sale.I got this phone in 3 days(8 day before as they guaranteed)  Box includes: Phone, Data cable, wall power adapter and user manual.

Worth every penny the best smart phone value of money but Asus did a mistake they didn't provide a case with it  	5
Terrific I am now using this for more then 10 days. So far it has been great experience. just for the reference, i am using galaxy S8 and pixel 2 mobiles and bought this for my son. i am really surprised to get this kind of performance in just 11000 Rs. no lags, super smooth, i don't feel any difference while using this mobile or pixel2. Screen is fantastic, battery life is amazingly good, it goes up to 4 days with about 7.5 hrs screen on time. Rear camera is again very nice. Actually for the price,  ...  	5
Terrible product don't buy this phone I received a faulty product there is a some scratches over the screen and also there is a charging issues in the phone and Flipkart doesn't take a responsibility of replacement i had lost my money please never buy this phone  	1
Mind-blowing purchase ITS FINGER PRINT SENSOR STOP WORKING AT ALL AFTER THE AUGUST UPDATE PROVIDED BY ASUS AND THERE IS  NO EXISTING SOLUTION GIVEN BY ASUS ON THAT PROBLEM.......best smartphone in this price range best battery life 5000mah.......no lag in gaming or multasking.......camera gets better with the update.....fingerprint and face unlock also got better with latest update........best part is stock andriod experience which result is high performance compared to other devices  	5
Terrible product it's overheating even before using. Reached out to Flipkart agent & she said reboot & reset & kept on repeating the same thing again & again. & finally rejected the return request Terrible Experience.  	1
Excellent Bought this on First Sale with 1year Protection Plan. Before giving brief review let me clear one thing, is that I was not happy with Preorder and product getting delivered almost 1 week after order. Review with Pros and Cons briefly described: 1. Good build quality. No complaint whatsoever. Design is plain and simple. 2. Display is quite brilliant for a device under 15K. 3. Battery life is extraordinary. I actually got bored doing battery test with this. There is no way you can discharge th...  	5
Value for money Good in hand feel and best specifications but few cons are 1- no screen protection (i.e no gorrila glass). 2-front selfie flash is really pathetic.(luminous intensity is very low). 3-fingerprint scanner is slow . 4-EIS  is now available after OTA update but it's not impressive . 5- instead of snapdragon 636 fast charging is not supported on this device.(takes more time to charge about 2.5-3hrs). Rest in every department this phone is bang on target  1- On moderate usage I get 2 days batte...  	5

Must buy! I am writing this review after a long term usage. I bought this phone on the first day of sale itself. 1.Over all design is good the camera module doesn't protrude it goes with body itelf.  2.Performance is snappy apps open fast sometimes a bit buggy. Can be improved on future update. If you guys play PUBG this is the phone to play. Gaming is smooth. No heating issue at all. It gets warm but it is usual for very smart phone out there. 3. Battery is greatly I was getting around 9.5 hrs of scre...  	5
Mind-blowing purchase The mobile is awesome however i havent received any FOTA updateas so far.  Have any body of you got any sw update??  	5

Nice product good phone  	4
Must buy! Definitely the best specifications at this price range. have A look at practical usage Pros: Best in class display. Speaker is awesome as said by asus it is much louder clear than other 15k segment smartphones. Great battery life(thamks to its huge 5000mAh battery)  on even heavy useage it will easily last for whole day.. and for normal usage it lasts for 2 days. Clean UI as it runs on stock android and you will get OTA updates faster. Design is good and it still looks slimmer dispite of...  	5
Mind-blowing purchase Price - reasonable battery - fantastic camera - back camera is very good frnt camera ok ok performance- superb display - good  	5
Perfect product! Outstanding performance by Asus at this price segment. I suggest you to go for it , if you want a budget smartphone.  	5
Good quality product Camera department is just fine. Apart from that phone's absolute beast.  back up, display, robustness all above par. The king phone of 11K range. If budget is 10K, add 1K and go for it. #HappyAsusUserFromLast4Years.  	4
Super! Best mobile it is! actually it's not pure black in colour! it is deep blue! the colour is better than  black!  Bigttery life; Big Screen, Good processor! Camera-Satisfied!

Best in the market! in this price range it's very good mobile with good battery backup & decent camera don't believe all fake reviews....  	5
Simply awesome Excellent mobile at that price. I think we shouldn't ask for more at that price. Pros: * Good build quality. * Excellent display. * Powerful processor. * Loved the stock android.  * Face unlock works well. * Good battery backup. * Both SIMs support VOLTE. Cons: * Somewhat poor camera interface and picture quality. I hope Asus will provide software updates on fixing it.  	5
Hated it! Honestly it is a over rated mobile. Spec wise it seems better than competitors but performance and quality is not up to the mark. I got this phone 3days ago as a replacement for my Lenovo VIBE K5 Note. Below are my ratings 1. Rear camera  : 1 out of 5 (images are blurry, noisey  and not sharp irrespective of all modes) 2. Front camera : 0 out of 5 (Auto white balance and image quality are worst)  3. Display : 2 out of 5 (color reproduction is bad for the resolution and size, bad contrast rati...  	1

Stack android  cons  6. Latest Android version  1.camera is not that good it's colour saturation is not that real . It gives yellow light in flash that doesn't make photos look good in flash . It only gives good pictures when there is more brightness in the room  2. Due to 2.5 D curvature you won't find a t...  	4
Awesome First Of All it is a killer of Note 5 Pro.Decent camera.But need little improvement in Front one.Value for money product.Remember it's a pure  stock Android.No hang issue till now.If you like customization then choose another one.Overall 9.5/10 including everything.Go For It  	5
Worth every penny great phone under 11000. battery power super. fantastic dual camera .audio quality fantastic with boat bass compared using with Lenovo k6 and Redmi note 4.snapdragon processor doing everything without any time-lag. better to use back cover as it is slippery.  	5
Perfect product! special thanks to Flipkart for giving best delivery service . delivery date is expected on 15 may and I got it on 7 may  Asus Zenfone max pro is great phone as I am continuously from 2 day  front camera and fingerprint scanner disappoints me but except like battery ,display ,audio ,video, is great  and if you are going to buy redmi note 5 pro  then I suggest you go for it as it is cheaper then redmi  	4
Mind-blowing purchase Amazing phone for a great price. I was in a dilemma between this phone and Nokia 7 Plus. I was leaning towards Android One, but after seeing tons of review about Asus Max Pro i thought of giving it a shot since its less than half the price of Nokia 7 Plus.  And I'm truly satisfied with my purchase. Pros: 1) Battery 2) Display - This is the best screen on a phone for <13k 3) OS - Its just Pure Android with 2-3 ASUS customised features 3) Built quality 4) Earpiece speaker Cons: 1) Camera - I...  	5
Nice product GOOD PRODUCT FROM ASUS - WORTH FOR MONEY - NICE TO HANDLE - PROS: SCREEN SIZE - 5.99', FACE LOCK, BATTERY CAPACITY, HARDWARE, NO HEAT PROBLEM, GOOD DESIGN, SUPER AUDIO, DEDICATED SLOT FOR 2 SIMS & SD CARD.                                                                         CONS: BATTERY NOT LIKE 5000MAH - CAN WITHSTAND 1 FULL DAY WITH NORMAL USAGE, LITTLE SLOWER, NO FAST CHARGER - IT TAKES 2.30Hrs TO CHARGE FROM 5-10%, AVERAGE CAMERA, NO GORILLA GLASS.                                     ...  	4

Super! it's a value for money but if u play pubg on it u can face some frame drop after the last sanhok update so don't worry I bought it on August that time the game was running smooth like butter in medium/hd graphics but after the sanhok update released on sept. it started having some frame drop issues I think the game only has some optimization issues and after the next pubg update rolls out I think it will be all okey. . display-is great . battery-good . camera-average(doesn't have optical ima...  	5
Android ONE saga along with SD 636 After 1 day of usage :  Display --- I have watched lots of YouTube Videos in 1080p, couple of movies (E.g. - Monster University, Inception, 3 idiots), played Asphalt 9, Watched couple of live stage performances etc. Everything is quite satisfied to my eyes and contrast + color accuracy + sharpness is brilliant. So, Recommended [10/10] Camera --- Back camera is more than enough for day to day life photography and video recording via back one is good [bit shaky but manageable].  Front is just...  	5

Hated it! Battery performance is not good as comparison to 5000mah.Very bad support from Flipkart and their service provider company jeeves. Refund policy is only to show. They do not apply these refund services. Very very bad experience.  	1
Did not meet expectations Display problem, sound problem, can't hear clear voice when calling...... And more.....  	1
Great product better than redmi not 5 pro  	5
Nice product wow.... the best phone I got @ this price...  pics are better in daylight.  	4
Not good everything good in this phone only the problem is its front camera. after all update camera performance is very artificially and bad it may be a deal broker point. its not able to stand front of redmi not 5 for camera  	2
Pretty good phone looks premium and display quality is great and battery lasts for around a day and a half with heavy usage only thing I didn't like is the camera ,front camera is below average and in rear camera the pics look oversaturated  	4
Don't waste your money Very bad performance, getting error while opening Camera "Can't connect to camera" and "System UI error". Performs very slow.  Lack of camera features like Slow motion videos, Timelapse. Double tap to awake screens fails all the time.  	1
Absolute rubbish! Good product but bad service by Flipkart Phone is good but had some issues build quality is not upto mark and screen display has some issues but Flipkart refused to replace it not satisfied with Flipkart service  	1

Terrific don't stuck in negative reviews..just go for it. the major issues which all are talking fingerprint and cameras. fingerprint sensors are improving much by updates..hope they will fix it soon. Both cameras of the phone are nice..the problem is with the app..that was waste..if we are installing Google cameras then you can feel the difference (major issue for this is this can done only through rooting). front cam is improving..but now also I'm not satisfied..but future updates will may improve i...  	5

Great product Best phone under the budget!! Superb battery, good camera and crisp display!!!  	5
Would recommend this if you don't bother much about camera I'd really recommend one to buy this phone. But do have a look at few factors. * Camera : 4/5   There is some problem with the quality of photos taken with the front camera. It doesn't seem like 8 MP camera. But I am sure ASUS will improve it through OTA updates.  Coming to rear camera it's performance is pretty good. It's on par with Redmi note 5 pro  (except during low light condition) * Performance : 5/5 No words... It's just amazing. We get to see the absolute amazing performance of the...  	5

Good quality product Looks and display is very good. battery is decent. expected more backup as I am just a normal user(no gaming) but it was down to 60% in general browsing in 4g.  download and browsing speed is fast. camera is not good for the given pixel. hope they improve camera performance in future updates. I am switching from Windows to Android. couldn't find any import or export function for copying contacts from my old phone.  it fell short of my expectations. After OTA  update battery is working proper...  	4

Very Good I have got the phone yesterday and have been using it since then. So i'm gonna write a review on the pros and cons of the phone i felt after using it. PROS: +BATTERY - It is having good battery backup.

Best in the market! Great come back by ASUS! Just read this once and i am sure your doubts will be cleared. The Pros as already mentioned in detailed summary in specifications.  So, directly coming what are the drawbacks yet present in this phone. The only cons present in this phone yet that the sharpness as seen in 'Redmi Note 5 Pro' is missing in Zenfone Max Pro M1 in the pictures that shoot from front camera (however, the same will be issued soon by OTA updates). Call recording, Ultra Power Saving Mode, Mu...  	5
Wonderful awesome display and battery back up with descent cameras.OTA update gave a change.... it is a best alternative for redmi note 5 pro.iam using note 5 pro too but Asus rear camera is better than note 5 pro and front cam is good in note 5 pro .Display and battery are the  highlight. gesture control is gud. thank u Flipkart and asus.  	5

Killer of Redmi Note 5 pro Best phone under  under 12000 K, I am sure this phone will overcome Redmi note 5 pro if Asus make open sale.I got this phone in 3 days(8 day before as they guaranteed)  Box includes: Phone, Data cable, wall power adapter and user manual.

Worth every penny the best smart phone value of money but Asus did a mistake they didn't provide a case with it  	5
Terrific I am now using this for more then 10 days. So far it has been great experience. just for the reference, i am using galaxy S8 and pixel 2 mobiles and bought this for my son. i am really surprised to get this kind of performance in just 11000 Rs. no lags, super smooth, i don't feel any difference while using this mobile or pixel2. Screen is fantastic, battery life is amazingly good, it goes up to 4 days with about 7.5 hrs screen on time. Rear camera is again very nice. Actually for the price,  ...  	5
Terrible product don't buy this phone I received a faulty product there is a some scratches over the screen and also there is a charging issues in the phone and Flipkart doesn't take a responsibility of replacement i had lost my money please never buy this phone  	1
Mind-blowing purchase ITS FINGER PRINT SENSOR STOP WORKING AT ALL AFTER THE AUGUST UPDATE PROVIDED BY ASUS AND THERE IS  NO EXISTING SOLUTION GIVEN BY ASUS ON THAT PROBLEM.......best smartphone in this price range best battery life 5000mah.......no lag in gaming or multasking.......camera gets better with the update.....fingerprint and face unlock also got better with latest update........best part is stock andriod experience which result is high performance compared to other devices  	5
Terrible product it's overheating even before using. Reached out to Flipkart agent & she said reboot & reset & kept on repeating the same thing again & again. & finally rejected the return request Terrible Experience.  	1
Excellent Bought this on First Sale with 1year Protection Plan. Before giving brief review let me clear one thing, is that I was not happy with Preorder and product getting delivered almost 1 week after order. Review with Pros and Cons briefly described: 1. Good build quality. No complaint whatsoever. Design is plain and simple. 2. Display is quite brilliant for a device under 15K. 3. Battery life is extraordinary. I actually got bored doing battery test with this. There is no way you can discharge th...  	5
Value for money Good in hand feel and best specifications but few cons are 1- no screen protection (i.e no gorrila glass). 2-front selfie flash is really pathetic.(luminous intensity is very low). 3-fingerprint scanner is slow . 4-EIS  is now available after OTA update but it's not impressive . 5- instead of snapdragon 636 fast charging is not supported on this device.(takes more time to charge about 2.5-3hrs). Rest in every department this phone is bang on target  1- On moderate usage I get 2 days batte...  	5

Must buy! I am writing this review after a long term usage. I bought this phone on the first day of sale itself. 1.Over all design is good the camera module doesn't protrude it goes with body itelf.  2.Performance is snappy apps open fast sometimes a bit buggy. Can be improved on future update. If you guys play PUBG this is the phone to play. Gaming is smooth. No heating issue at all. It gets warm but it is usual for very smart phone out there. 3. Battery is greatly I was getting around 9.5 hrs of scre...  	5
Mind-blowing purchase The mobile is awesome however i havent received any FOTA updateas so far.  Have any body of you got any sw update??  	5

Must buy! Definitely the best specifications at this price range. have A look at practical usage Pros: Best in class display. Speaker is awesome as said by asus it is much louder clear than other 15k segment smartphones. Great battery life(thamks to its huge 5000mAh battery)  on even heavy useage it will easily last for whole day.. and for normal usage it lasts for 2 days. Clean UI as it runs on stock android and you will get OTA updates faster. Design is good and it still looks slimmer dispite of...  	5
Mind-blowing purchase Price - reasonable battery - fantastic camera - back camera is very good frnt camera ok ok performance- superb display - good  	5
Perfect product! Outstanding performance by Asus at this price segment. I suggest you to go for it , if you want a budget smartphone.  	5
Good quality product Camera department is just fine. Apart from that phone's absolute beast.  back up, display, robustness all above par. The king phone of 11K range. If budget is 10K, add 1K and go for it. #HappyAsusUserFromLast4Years.  	4
Super! Best mobile it is! actually it's not pure black in colour! it is deep blue! the colour is better than  black!  Bigttery life; Big Screen, Good processor! Camera-Satisfied! No heating problem al all! finger print sensor is little slow! gaming experience is awasome! better than any mobile available in  market now! overall its an awesome experience.  	5
Best in the market! in this price range it's very good mobile with good battery backup & decent camera don't believe all fake reviews....  	5
Simply awesome Excellent mobile at that price. I think we shouldn't ask for more at that price. Pros: * Good build quality. * Excellent display. * Powerful processor. * Loved the stock android.  * Face unlock works well. * Good battery backup. * Both SIMs support VOLTE. Cons: * Somewhat poor camera interface and picture quality. I hope Asus will provide software updates on fixing it.  	5
Hated it! Honestly it is a over rated mobile. Spec wise it seems better than competitors but performance and quality is not up to the mark. I got this phone 3days ago as a replacement for my Lenovo VIBE K5 Note. Below are my ratings 1. Rear camera  : 1 out of 5 (images are blurry, noisey  and not sharp irrespective of all modes) 2. Front camera : 0 out of 5 (Auto white balance and image quality are worst)  3. Display : 2 out of 5 (color reproduction is bad for the resolution and size, bad contrast rati...  	1

Stack android  cons  6. Latest Android version  1.camera is not that good it's colour saturation is not that real . It gives yellow light in flash that doesn't make photos look good in flash . It only gives good pictures when there is more brightness in the room  2. Due to 2.5 D curvature you won't find a t...  	4
Awesome First Of All it is a killer of Note 5 Pro.Decent camera.But need little improvement in Front one.Value for money product.Remember it's a pure  stock Android.No hang issue till now.If you like customization then choose another one.Overall 9.5/10 including everything.Go For It  	5
Worth every penny great phone under 11000. battery power super. fantastic dual camera .audio quality fantastic with boat bass compared using with Lenovo k6 and Redmi note 4.snapdragon processor doing everything without any time-lag. better to use back cover as it is slippery.  	5
Perfect product! special thanks to Flipkart for giving best delivery service . delivery date is expected on 15 may and I got it on 7 may  Asus Zenfone max pro is great phone as I am continuously from 2 day  front camera and fingerprint scanner disappoints me but except like battery ,display ,audio ,video, is great  and if you are going to buy redmi note 5 pro  then I suggest you go for it as it is cheaper then redmi  	4
Mind-blowing purchase Amazing phone for a great price. I was in a dilemma between this phone and Nokia 7 Plus. I was leaning towards Android One, but after seeing tons of review about Asus Max Pro i thought of giving it a shot since its less than half the price of Nokia 7 Plus.  And I'm truly satisfied with my purchase. Pros: 1) Battery 2) Display - This is the best screen on a phone for <13k 3) OS - Its just Pure Android with 2-3 ASUS customised features 3) Built quality 4) Earpiece speaker Cons: 1) Camera - I...  	5
Nice product GOOD PRODUCT FROM ASUS - WORTH FOR MONEY - NICE TO HANDLE - PROS: SCREEN SIZE - 5.99', FACE LOCK, BATTERY CAPACITY, HARDWARE, NO HEAT PROBLEM, GOOD DESIGN, SUPER AUDIO, DEDICATED SLOT FOR 2 SIMS & SD CARD.                                                                         CONS: BATTERY NOT LIKE 5000MAH - CAN WITHSTAND 1 FULL DAY WITH NORMAL USAGE, LITTLE SLOWER, NO FAST CHARGER - IT TAKES 2.30Hrs TO CHARGE FROM 5-10%, AVERAGE CAMERA, NO GORILLA GLASS.                                     ...  	4

Super! it's a value for money but if u play pubg on it u can face some frame drop after the last sanhok update so don't worry I bought it on August that time the game was running smooth like butter in medium/hd graphics but after the sanhok update released on sept. it started having some frame drop issues I think the game only has some optimization issues and after the next pubg update rolls out I think it will be all okey. . display-is great . battery-good . camera-average(doesn't have optical ima...  	5
Android ONE saga along with SD 636 After 1 day of usage :  Display --- I have watched lots of YouTube Videos in 1080p, couple of movies (E.g. - Monster University, Inception, 3 idiots), played Asphalt 9, Watched couple of live stage performances etc. Everything is quite satisfied to my eyes and contrast + color accuracy + sharpness is brilliant. So, Recommended [10/10] Camera --- Back camera is more than enough for day to day life photography and video recording via back one is good [bit shaky but manageable].  Front is just...  	5

Mind-blowing purchase Excellent mobile with a very good price... camera is dam good... happy with asus  	5
Hated it! Battery performance is not good as comparison to 5000mah.Very bad support from Flipkart and their service provider company jeeves. Refund policy is only to show. They do not apply these refund services. Very very bad experience.  	1
Did not meet expectations Display problem, sound problem, can't hear clear voice when calling...... And more.....  	1
Great product better than redmi not 5 pro  	5
Nice product wow.... the best phone I got @ this price...  pics are better in daylight.  	4
Not good everything good in this phone only the problem is its front camera. after all update camera performance is very artificially and bad it may be a deal broker point. its not able to stand front of redmi not 5 for camera  	2
Pretty good phone looks premium and display quality is great and battery lasts for around a day and a half with heavy usage only thing I didn't like is the camera ,front camera is below average and in rear camera the pics look oversaturated  	4
Don't waste your money Very bad performance, getting error while opening Camera "Can't connect to camera" and "System UI error". Performs very slow.  Lack of camera features like Slow motion videos, Timelapse. Double tap to awake screens fails all the time.  	1
Absolute rubbish! Good product but bad service by Flipkart Phone is good but had some issues build quality is not upto mark and screen display has some issues but Flipkart refused to replace it not satisfied with Flipkart service  	1
