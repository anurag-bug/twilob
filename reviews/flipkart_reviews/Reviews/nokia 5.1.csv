Good choice I got this product on the first sale. It was delivered in 2days. At first look I was disappointed because of the packing. Other than that, the phone itself is a looker, it was really good to handle, good build quality and battery was holding for more than 24 hours for normal usage. The camera quality on the Rear is good, but front cam is not on level to 8MP.  I bought it for the Android one and Type-C port, but while using I found a few glitches here and there. Notch  implementation is not...  	4
Terrific purchase The Nokia 5.1 Plus is equipped with an octa-core MediaTek processor which is joined with 3GB of RAM to pass on quality and reliable execution. The mobile phone is ideal for the people who need to tackle different applications meanwhile or are a consistent multitasker. The device in like manner enables slack free execution while you acknowledge beguilements on the white screen. To the extent battery, the phone tastes juice from a non removable Li-lon 3060 mAh battery which most likely won't s...  	5

Wonderful Nice product  	4
Horrible Display not working ! Problem right from day one . Had a lot of expectations from Nokia but this was a big let off! Raised the issue earlier but the technician got the phone to work somehow. Continued working for 10 days and now I'm left stranded since my 10 day replacement period is over and the phone is not working! Absolutely useless phone. Pls provide replacement or provide a replacement immediately!!  	1
Absolute rubbish! display damaged in only one day due very glossy from rear side . extra glossy causes slippery on normal plane also . not suitable for rough user  	1
Not recommended at all Very bad policy if customer not satisfied with product ask many questions and give irretrievable reasons and deny to return  	1

Classy product Superb phone with all features nicely covered. The phone looks fairly classy for 10.5k price tag. Camera is good in adequtely lit conditions however strugges a little in low light however cannot expect much at this price point. Battery easily lasts 24 hr for a moderate user, thanks to helio p60 processor which is impressively optimized for such superior performancce and you wont feel any lag in any case. Android one programme offers frequent updates and I'm just suprised to two updates in the...  	5

Classy product Good & Primiam smartphone  	5
Worth the money Mobile looks great.-premium looks.Camera is pretty good for the price.Easy to navigate..not cluttered with too many apps..fingerprint scanner is fine.A bit slippery so better use gorilla glass and back cover.Overall worth the price.Cons: However , i am a bit disappointed by the screen black out problem faced twice within 3 days of usage.  It lasted for 15-20 mins till the screen became live on its own( screen light is dull and looks black and it freezed). Nokia cc advised to reboot; do factor...  	4
Worth the money Poor phone, big problem is screen turning off. So neve bought this bogus phone  	4
Perfect product! The mobile looks so Premium for its price.  The MediaTek Helio P60 delivers stunningly fast speed. (No Lags even while heavy gaming) the stock Android gives it the edge over other mobiles nearby 10k. the rear camera is very good. (Actually Best in this price)  battery backup is also very impressive. Android one keeps the device up to date....  (Android Pie update will make this even better)  At Last.....  To be honest this device is I think way better than the redmi note 5 Pro.  	5

It's HD+ display but it seems FHD.  * Camera is average, u can click decent pics. Detailing on pic below average. this phone not for Camera lover. but it clicks photos better than Asus M1. *Battery life is good, it gives 1 day battery life on average use.

Best in the market! very good looking mobile  	5
Not recommended at all Don't buy this product  	1
Terrific purchase First of all .. the build quality for this price range is amazing. feels so much premium and it's performance is also amazing as it has helio P60. I have purchased both 6.1 plus and 5.1 plus at the same time... and using both. Don't get me wrong but as much as I used both... I feel that 5.1 plus is better value for money. Most of the times it outperform 6.1 plus. It's faster than 6.1 plus in almost every aspect. My genuine advice will be that... if You are satisfied with 32 GB storage & 720p ...  	5
