Classy product Nice products  	5
Good quality product Only 3000 mah battery looks good from outside finish, handy and feeling good 1) mediatek heilo p22, not good as smooth as Snapdragon 450, lags from normal use 2) battery capacity 3000mah, not satisfactory backup, needed improvement  3) HD plus display not vibrant as fhd, it will be better if company used fhd or fhd+ 3) average camera performance, portrait mode works very well 4) MIUI version is old, need update as soon as possible.  5) no notch display, realme 2 gives it by spending only 1k 6...  	4

Super! Just after breaking the seal holding the phone for the first gives you an amazing feel. The device fits perfectly in hands, pretty light. Thanks to 18:9 aspect ratio. The display is crisp. I buy Xiaomi phones for MIUI only. Its buttery smooth. I don't know why people complain about it. The back of the phone looks gorgeous trust me. Though it has a plastic body but without touching it you can't distinguish its plastic or metal. Overall you can't get better than this. Go for it. Antutu score is...  	5
Very Good Redmi 6 Launched on 10 September, Mi brand is a great phone this month this phone is great with Redmi 5A, Redmi 6 is very happyness phones and phone screen size is best,  	4

Good 1.battery hardly last for 12 to 15 hours after full charge. battery could be more powerfull. 2.front camera ok with this price as 5MP but rear camera could be much batter as 13MP. 3.display size small as width is less than other Mi mobile. 4.picture quality average. 5.take up to 2.30 hours for full charge  	3

Absolute rubbish! low quality from MI.. Now MI is targeting only profit compromising quality 1. Both rear & front cameras r below average.. dual rear cam is just a gimmick.. EIS is bogus.. cam video quality is hazy 2. Battery backup is below average 3. Mediatek pros is sometimes lagging even  in plain tasks(I don't do mobile gaming that much) 4. Any video - cam or YouTube or HD video display quality is worst..slightly hazy 5. Display light dimming problem in very low brightness ...DON'T BUY Redmi 6 (sayi...  	1

For 16 gb internal storage company must give an option to move app to memory for which  one can enjoy with lots of apps smothly.  - Camera on portrait mode is also a major con of it because u can see lagging issue which frustate you.

Just wow! awesome  	5
Simply awesome It's a great device for the price (6999).  Display (4/5): It's an okay 720p display. Due to the large screen size, pixel density is reduced which is visible while watching YouTube. Battery (5/5): A solid 4250 mAh battery to last through the day with no hassle. Build (5/5): Excellent build quality for the price. Even though it's made out of plastic, it doesn't feel cheap at all and the glossy finish definitely adds style while attracting considerable amount of fingerprint. Using with back c...  	5

Best in the market! Inexpressible purchase ever ! Here's some points:- Pros:  * The most important pro is it's battery. U can use upto two days (even more than that) on moderate usage.  * It's another advantage is its high efficient 'SD 450' processor which runs the device smoothly.  * Display is something extraordinary to me. Smooth touch response.  * Design of the device is pretty good and attractive. Everyone bound to fall in love !  * Realme c1's camera is good, but not the best. This is acceptable at this ...  	5

Super! Decent mobile in this price. Stunning looks with notch. Performance is not extremely super but more than enough for day to day usage. Battery life is great with a 1and half day minimum life with full charge. Cameras are too surprisingly stunning.  This is initially order for my father but used for my self for few days. As I satisfied with this phone, I ordered realme 2 with 3gb ram and fingerprint sensor and given this to my father. Thanks to Realme.  	5
Fabulous! The phone is awesome.. It camera is impressive both front nd back camera. Yet only 2 problem i faced in this phone that performance is little bit slow but its okay nd second problem is face id unlock it do not work at night nd after applying lock also my screen is not locked. Ignoring these 2 problem at this range phone is amazing really love it..  	5

Great product Bang for buck. The phone will Satisfy you with the price you paid for it. camera is good but not the same as 9lite,even tough the configuration is same. :display is like 8.5 out of 10. :sound quality is too impressive. :processor is nice in normal usage.yet,can't say about heavy usage ,or gaming . :looks are too good,and design is ergonomic.Just hope that the side rims with chrome plate do not get shredded with time.  	5
Excellent fantastic phone  	5
Mind-blowing purchase the product is excellent but should be provided with fiber or screen guard as you know the product is new in the market so it's accessories may not be easily available... Also it's doesn't even have an earphone... the company should be held responsible for it...  	5

Not good product. Recommend not to buy Worst phone ever. Battery charging time 6-7hours and draining time 5 hours with 100% charge. Camera quality is also poor. Requested for return but a massage came that seller wants to talk to me but no call came from seller. A day after the return request has been rejected by seller. Feeling cheated. Recommend not to buy. Flipkart do not take any responsibility. They just sell item from their app and take profit. If your product is good then then you are lucky and if not good then you are loos...  	1

Very Good Value for money. Worth every penny of yours. At 9k price range this is the best offering in the market. If you are not more of a gamer guy or a mobile photography geek, then no need to worry about. In this device honor tried to give you all the experiences, but you can't expect perfection.   Pros. HD+ resolution screen Stylish 18:9 aspect ratio Dual rear camera Dual Bluetooth connectivity Sleek Metal unibody design Faster fingerprint sensor Face unlock Android 8.0 Dual SIM + SD card Cons.

Great Choice I love honor phones for the look, display and EMUI. Personally don't prefer MI for its UI. Reviewing after 1 week of usage.  When it comes to the look and feel, this phone is really good. Shiny, classy, resembles iPhone. Thin and curvy edges. Less weight as well.  Pros: Display is cool as it is, even though not full HD, feels like a HD screen.  Camera - Front is awesome with 8mp. Rear is OK for its price, we got the dual one. Takes reasonable pics. No concerns about it. Portrait works fine ...  	4

Waste of money! over heating and camera is third class  	1
Nice The cellphone look is good. Slim. Screen size 5'7" is nice, looks professional. camera n video quality is not good enough. Internet processing is not that good. But with a price of 9k, it is OK.  	3
Expected a better product no magnetic field,compass does not work. low battery backup.  	2
Don't waste your money Worst product.  I received the defective piece. out of 2 speakers, one s not worked also while charging the touch was hanged. I'm struggling to return the product for more than two weeks. still no process. Always the customer care telling the troubleshoot steps (which we already tried). Its clearly visible that they are delaying the process of returns and making the customer got irritate and force us to use the same defective product. If you receive the good product, then it will be nice,if n...  	1
