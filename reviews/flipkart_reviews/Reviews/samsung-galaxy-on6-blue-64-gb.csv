Really Nice amazing phone specially the amoled display rest is preety descent and overall good phone for a moderate user but not for those who plays extensive games and multitasking. camera is average, battery easily last for whole day and phone is compact to hold. if u aren't a Samsung fan there's not much left to go for it  	4

Must buy! Very light weight and decent look battery performance little be upset other wise phn is very good performe. Definitely suggest to buy this phone with a world class brand 'samsung' at this price, thanks flipkart.  	5
Brilliant my budget was very low but trying to get good phone as par brand, specifications and performace finally bought this phone value for money looking good size also good for handling...  	5
Value-for-money A good phone in the under 15k range. Decent specifications with good looks.  	4
Excellent I am very happy this produced  	5
Highly recommended Nice mobile phone super  	5
Worth the money Specs are good. I don't know how Samsung ended with such lousy theme as default one. It sucks. The position of speaker above power button is another weird design. Display is good. It is real dual SIM phone with 1 SIM+1SIM & Micro Memory card slots. New Samsung features are included. As usual some features like AOD (Always On Display) found in high end phones not included. Music is okay. Camera is okay. Nothing to boast. Android 8.  On the whole,  4-star can be given to this phone.  	4
Just okay All features what I am getting is good but after spending 14k around still missing some kind of features as compared to other major brands like Nokia,  honor and VIVO.  Some Major features missing like Led Notification , Fast charging and HD resolution display. So guys please look into this where major back drop of this phone beacuse now a days without fast charging I can't imagine myself... I doesn't want old days like carrying mobile power banks.  	3
Perfect product! nice product slim and cute  	5
Best in the market! got delivered in just 6 hours...  great...  even loved the features of the phone with latest features...  smartthings..  in it...  loved it..  over all 10stars .. having lot of features like prime high end samsung s6 s7 and s8... simply awesome..  	5

Horrible i feed up with its network problem...i just want to throw it on a stone.  	1
Best in the market! This new launched phone by Samsung is so awesome and stylish, design and look of this phone is like S8+. But as you all know it has less some features and less sensors but this is awesome for normal user check the specifications and features before buying, I loved this phone.  	5
Great product d best mid range budget samsung smartphone. the looks the feel the infinity samoled display with curved edges.the light weight and the design makes it different from other samsung smartphones.samsung made a lot of renovations in this handset even with the fingerprint scanner .definitely a good surprise from samsunh..  	5
Excellent Very bad Mobile. Fault on battery but no replacement of mobile. Service very bad. My own experience. Please reply  	1
Worth every penny excellent product from samsung  	5
Don't waste your money don't buy this mobile where bad experience  	1
Very poor very bad phone plz dont buy it.... display blinks in many games and perfomance is slow for heavy games and battery life is half day only.. flipkart is horrible  	1
Waste of money! Very bad product this product hanging and very low battery backup . Flipkart not replace my mobile phone . Cheat flipkart  	1
Super! Plus point - 4GB ram 64GB Rom in 13.5k, infinity display, good look, brand name (suitable for who dont like to waste much money on phone and need branded phone with above average specs. negative - no fast charging support that's it rest all are better than same range other companies phones.  	5
Terrific good camera and other performance but screen size is small  	5
Absolute rubbish! Low Performance and average look, Low battery Backup  	1
Did not meet expectations very bad phon and  camera  quality,,  never  buy  any  phone  from flipkart without seeing  set any person hand or  in shop,,  flipkart is frod in selling phones  	1
Mind-blowing purchase wow awsm mobile .........  	5
Worth every penny very nice  	5
Must buy! super speed good  	5
Very Good Nice phone under the cost. Full value of money.  	4
Simply awesome nice mobile   	5
Not recommended at all i am genuine buyer and let me tell you this is worst phone hangs alot and once gets hanged you have no option but to wait coz this phone has non removable battery so you can't restart by taking out battery and inserting it again .. once i had to wait for 20 minutes to get it back to normal and some basic features have not been given like gyroscope  and compass as without compass your gps wont help you reach your destination with ease as it will not readjust itself using compass function ...so...  	1
Useless product Extreme poor experience with flipkart. You should write clearly in exchange policy that only new product will be valid for exchange...a phone in excellent condition is denied for exchange. Even an alien can't notice the crack in body with magnifying glasses but flipkart courier boy did.  	1
Brilliant this mobile is too good . battery backup are more good. picture quality super hd.  	5
Great product Don't buy this phone becoz its poor connectivity .signal issue  	5
Must buy! Amazing AMOLED display   	5
Did not meet expectations unexpected with Samsung  	1
Must buy! The device performance made me mad.No need to think of any issue it is so better than j6.  	5
Mind-blowing purchase nice phone...  	5
Very Good Sleek and attractive phone with very good battery life, average camera, face detection, samoled display... but it lacks with sensors...  	4
perfect for me What I want in a phone is 1) light wt, sleek design, elegant look, easy to carry, easy to hold in palm or shirt pocket 2) good battery life 3) good sound quality. The call should be heard clearly on both ends. 4) absolutely no heating issue, either while charging or using On each criteria selected by me, this phone stands true. So I am giving 5 star.  Pl note the camera, aparture, gaming,  processor, chipset, oreo, nought..... lab lab lab everthing is useless for me.  	5
Value for Money and great mobile from Samsung . Nice product from Samsung .  90 % Features are same as Mi note 5 pro . The best part is it has face unlock nd fingerprint . Value for money .Nd fast delivery from flipkart.  	5
Phone looks premium Phone looks premium, But the size is bit small.  	4
Just wow! received very next day of my order. phone looking excellent and stylish especially for girls... performance review will be later  	5
Waste of money! PUBG lags because the Processor is not supportive not good. For a Snap dragon processor with samsung  	1
Really Samrat phone Samsung first time make some good  	5
Must buy! good  	5
Fair 1)Battery is not up to the mark.  It comes only ten hours and it will take more than 2 hours to  full charge.2) some times slow working..  Don't know why.  I'm not satisfied with this mobile.  Pls don't go for this  	3

Fabulous! nice phone,,  	5
Perfect product! amazing display and performance i love it no battery issue just go it  	5
Must buy! I got it for 13k after 10% discount on SBI card, phone is very much value for money. I find it far better to own a Samsung phone rather than cheap products from Xiomi or Asus like Redmi Note 5/ Y2 or Zenphone.. it's camera is far better with all other phones in this budget. Performance and battery power management is good in this new series. and most importantly infinity display is really the best at this price.  	5
Very Good phone is good and stylish.. But camera is average... Performance is like premium model phones.  	4
Wonderful I have purchased this mobile set for a hard core Samsung fan and he is delighted after holding it. He is very moderate user and happy to have this device. But I must say Samsung should comes up with better product to compete with Xioami,  Vivo,  Oppo......  	4
Great product brilliant quality thanks flipkart  	5

Did not meet expectations When I rcvd this phone...not happy with its performance....its screen size...etc...so I put a return request....Both back cover and mobile came in one packing.....where as they took back only back cover...why so?? now status for mobile was showing return approved....and after 2 days since there was no reply I called up customer care...n they relied back with email saying return request refused....There is no option of refund neither replacement....worst thing it is....you either take the mobi...  	1
Good choice Notification LED, lock screen using screen button, automatic brightness, one click battery statistics, and double tap to wakeup screen like oneplus phones are missing. (comparing to my old oneplus x) Samsung apps take unnecessary space in the memory. Basic ear phone is provided instead of in ear. Normal charger with 5V 1A current rating. Go for it if you're looking for Samsung mid range phones considering above cons. Overall a good small phone with big screen.  	4
Decent product There is a change in Samsung  Samsung's product is good, but the camera has low quality In it Samsung should have had to change. This mobile display is very good. light weight     The camera should be upgraded so Samsung has always been working well  	3
Highly recommended Awesome phone camera is really great it's better than I phone 7  	5
Just wow! super fon and full maza  	1
Must buy! nice phone  	5
